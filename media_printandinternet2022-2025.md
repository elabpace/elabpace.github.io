> **With fewer protections and higher interest rates than consumer cards, is it truly worth it for a small business to have and use a business card versus a personal one for business expenses?**
> There are a number of reasons why a business card would be more advantageous to a small business than using personal credit cards. Common reasons are more sophisticated expense tracking and reporting and the ability to set customizable spending limits. Small business owners should also recognize that employees may not be comfortable using their personal credit cards, filing an expense report, and then waiting for reimbursement. While consumer protection laws generally do not apply to business cards, issuers may still extend protections to be competitive.
> 
> **Should all small business owners or self-employed individuals have a business credit card for expenses? If not, which businesses benefit most from having a business card?**
> A business expense may be made on a personal or business card. Charging something on a business card does not automatically make it a legitimate business expense, and the use of a personal credit card does not make a business expense any less legitimate. Many small business owners and self-employed individuals find it more appropriate and convenient to segregate personal and business expenses by using different cards for each purpose.

> **What are some ways you can maximize travel credit card rewards for your business?**
> The benefit of credit card travel rewards can be maximized by using them in creative ways, for example, as an incentive or rewards program for all employees. Instead of simply having those who fly for business accumulate travel rewards for personal use, the business could pool those rewards and award them to deserving employees who may never fly for work.

> **Then does it make sense to get a travel business credit card with a steep annual fee?**
> A steep annual fee on a travel business credit card may be justified for a variety of reasons depending on the business. For businesses with high credit card spending, the value of the associated bonus points may simply exceed the higher annual fee. The value of other benefits, such as airport lounge access, may either exceed the cost of the annual fee or simply be deemed as an advantage worth paying for.
