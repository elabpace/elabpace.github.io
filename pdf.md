**Entrepreneurship is a mindset** <br/>
February 21, 2021 <br/>
By **Dr Kudzanai Vere** <br/>
> Bruce Bachenheimer, clinical professor of management and executive director of the entrepreneurship laboratory at Pace University, defined entrepreneurship as imagining new ways to solve problems and create value. It is about the ability to recognise and methodically analyse an opportunity and, ultimately capture its value.
>
> I picked five dimensions of an entrepreneurship mindset in Professor Bachenheimer’s sentiments that I will explore.

**Is the MBA dead? Experts weigh in** <br/>
February 19, 2021 <br/>
By **Ryan Luke** <br/>
> Bruce Bachenheimer, a professor of management at the Lubin School of Business, told USNews, “project-based learning activities in MBA courses allow students to practice solving real business problems. Ultimately, this can help students become more creative thinkers, and this type of education tends to have a lasting impact.”
>
> Bachenheimer continued, “An MBA can be much more than the knowledge and skills acquired through coursework; it can truly expand you and your world.” It’s apparent by the significant increase in MBA enrollment that students believe the MBA program is still alive and relevant.

**Should You Pursue an MBA Amid Coronavirus?** <br/>

> Bruce Bachenheimer, a clinical professor of management with the Pace University [Lubin School of Business](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/pace-university-new-york-01309) in New York City, suggests that admitted MBA students account for the type of MBA program they were accepted into when determining whether to enroll or postpone their study plans.
>
> "When considering a top tier MBA program, interactions among one’s cohort, academic and social, is absolutely one of the most valuable aspects of the program and I would recommend deferring admission until traditional classes and regular activities are certain to resume," Bachenheimer wrote in an email. "For other programs, where there is not necessarily a strong cohort model, chancing a semester of remote learning is not as consequential. This would especially be the case for part-time programs."

**Op-Ed: Entrepreneurs are sure to find inspiration in the pandemic** <br/>

> The great baseball philosopher Yogi Berra once said, "It's difficult to make predictions, especially about the future."
>
> That might sound somewhat inane, but the underlying message is astute: The future is not only unpredictable, it’s unknowable.
>
> Although that is especially true when it comes to human behavior and societal norms—and so many variables are changing the way we teach, learn, worship and socialize these days—we can expect that innovative business concepts will be born out of the Covid-19 crisis.
>
> How do we know?
>
> Entrepreneurship often is associated with some form of disruption, the creation of a significant change in the market. There is perhaps no time more ripe for disruption than during a crisis.
>
> Airbnb and Uber were founded amid the 2008 financial crisis, and they probably would not have succeeded if either was launched a few years earlier—or later, for that matter. Why? Ordinary people would not have been willing to turn their home into a hotel or their car into a taxi absent the financial distress they were facing. Same for customers, who suddenly were willing to sleep in a stranger’s bed and pay for a ride in a regular car.
>
> Once those concepts proved successful, they were able to become parts of the new normal.
>
> We’re seeing emerging trends in meetings, deliveries, production and manufacturing that no doubt will evolve in an era defined by the coronavirus, social distancing and remote working.
>
> It’s important to remember that entrepreneurship is not solely about coming up with an interesting idea; it’s about the passion, persistence and perseverance to actually make it happen. Successful entrepreneurs stay focused on creating solutions that provide value to customers by solving problems and providing benefits.
>
> In these unprecedented times, everyone should bear in mind that entrepreneurship is much broader than the creation of a new business venture. At its core, it is a mindset—a way of thinking and acting. It is about imagining new ways to solve problems and create value.
>
> Fundamentally, entrepreneurship is about the ability to recognize, analyze and ultimately capture the value of an opportunity. Such skills are important for those seeking to establish new ventures. And they’re critical for a variety of professional careers, given today’s hypercompetitive marketplace, where rapid technological innovation and globalization has changed the very nature of work.
>
> Today every institution is facing enormous uncertainty and unique challenges. How are we helping to solve problems and provide benefits to our organizations?
>
> Where might entrepreneurial thinking and innovation play critical roles in dealing with the challenges and uncertainty we are confronting, particularly in the New York metropolitan area? Clearly, one place to start would be dealing with critical supply shortages, from personal protective equipment and medical testing kits to common household supplies and specialized industrial components. Perhaps a transformation of the supply chain and modernized manufacturing will bring new commercial opportunities to our region.
>
> For decades the push has been toward lean manufacturing, with massive economies of scale and just-in-time inventory systems coupled with efficient international supply chains. It has led to globalization and an unrelenting drive toward low-cost manufacturing. That efficiency is not effective when people can’t get items as simple as toilet paper, protective masks and hand sanitizer. When manufacturing is idled due to the inability to source a few key components that were being delivered daily to lower costs by fractions of a percent, that’s not efficient.
>
> When we don’t manufacture critical medical supplies and states are forced to outbid each other with foreign suppliers, that is beyond inefficient and ineffective. The lowest price is irrelevant when there is no supply. There might be a shift from depending on overseas manufacturers and global supply chains to more reliable local alternatives, at least for a number of key industries.
>
> New York is well-positioned to develop new businesses that shift manufacturing from massive to nimble and distribution from scale to flexibility. Our workforce is driven and adaptable, with the spirit to think and act more like committed entrepreneurs than just employees. The shift might even lead to a type of localized industrial revolution, disrupting industries and transforming our systems of management and production. Or just a "locavore" movement for industry.
>
> Whatever happens, making predictions and coming up with ideas won’t solve the challenges we are facing, but innovation and entrepreneurship might.
>
> Remember what Yogi Berra said: "It ain’t over ’til it’s over."

**New Yorkers Step Up to Help Mom-and-Pop Businesses** <br/>
April 7, 2020 (in print on April 8th, Page A12B) <br/>
By **Anne Kadet** <br/>
> 
> Like many New Yorkers, Ms. Struss fears that many mom-and-pop shops won’t survive the shutdown, and she’s determined to help them stay afloat.
> 
> Such concerns aren’t unfounded. Even a well-run small business typically has less than two months of operating capital in reserve, says Bruce Bachenheimer, a management professor at Pace University’s Lubin School of Business.
> 
> The businesses best positioned to survive, meanwhile, are the most creative and flexible outfits, says Mr. Bachenheimer, the Pace professor, citing the example of a pottery studio that recently started assembling and delivering DIY pottery kits to people stuck at home. “Darwin didn’t say it’s the strongest species that survive,” he says. “It’s those that are able to adapt.”
> 
> Still, the Chappaqua, N.Y., resident wants to see local stores stay afloat. To that end, he suggests customers buy gift cards from neighborhood shops and restaurants to use when they reopen, and ask for a credit rather than a refund on services not delivered, such as a canceled catering event.
> 
> It can be for a selfish reason. “If all these stores go out of business, what happens to your neighborhood life and property values?” he asks.

> I started with a Rhodes 22 sailboat that I purchased new in 1989 for daysailing on the Hudson River. In 1990, I purchased a Pearson 36 Cutter, which I lived aboard for several years and sailed from New England through the Caribbean to South America and back to Annapolis, Maryland. Now a family man, I own an Island Packet 27, which I bought in 2016 and use for coastal cruising in Long Island Sound and along the Rhode Island and Massachusetts coasts.

> I went from a daysailer to a bluewater cruiser to now something in the middle. Each change met my lifestyle at different points. Now I typically do two two-week cruises with my family (wife, teenage daughter, and sometimes our dog) and a bunch of shorter/weekend trips — about half of those solo.

> **It can send the wrong message to clients and employees.**
> 
> “In the 1980s, you couldn't spend enough money," Bruce Bachenheimer, director of the Entrepreneurship Lab at Pace University in New York, told The Street. "But today clients are saying, 'Forget the hunting trip, forget the lavish treatment — just give me a better price."
> 
> Bachenheimer added, "If you're rolling out the red carpet for a customer, they're going to assume you have incredibly high margins to do all that spending. They're going to think, 'Oh, he's overcharging everyone — including me — in order to afford all this."
> 
> Besides sending the wrong message to clients, it could also anger employees. If you’re going all-in on lavish presents for clients, while your teammates haven’t received a bonus, they’ll question why. Remember, your team can make or break your business. You need to keep your teammates happy and ensure they feel appreciated.

> **Regulations** <br/>
> While regulations can create high expenses for companies, those that go through tremendous regulatory hurdles for the SEC, auditors or other regulatory bodies have higher valuations, because the regulations work to prevent fraud and accurately identify risk.
>
> “What’s a problem is regulations that don’t make sense, but the idea that regulation is hurting business is misunderstood at best,” said Bruce Bachenheimer, Clinical Professor of Management and Executive Director of the Entrepreneurship Lab at Pace University. “Financial regulation will cost companies money in compliance, but the value of their stock is exponentially higher because they comply with that regulation.”
> 
> Regulations do serve to protect businesses and their operations, but they can also prevent innovation. Lobbying for restrictions to maintain the status quo and protect businesses might work for a short period, but then the city will eventually falter, said Bruce.
>
> **Talent** <br/>
> When companies look to establish operations somewhere new, they look at the ability to hire talent to help that business grow. What these companies often look for is the integration of universities and their degree programs into the local ecosystem.
>
> Areas with universities that have programs in AI, robotics and machine learning, for example, attract forward-looking companies.
>
> Talent serves many roles though. Today, the basis for a competitive advantage is innovation in all forms, and the only source of innovation is human talent, said Bruce: “These days with globalization, hyper competition and shorter lifecycles, the only way to survive is with innovation.”

**Want to Diversify? Start Here** <br/>
September 2018 (Vol. 47, Issue 7, Page 17 print edition) <br/>
By **Elizabeth O'Brien** <br/>
> "It's important for you to think of yourself as CEO of \[Your Name Here\]," says Bruce Bachenheimer, professor of management at Pace University in Manhattan. No matter what your field, you can put an entrepreneurial mindset to your advantage. Here's what to do:
>
> **\> THINK LIKE A DISRUPTER.**
>
> This attitude is essential, no matter where you work. Think about your industry and how you can help your employer respond to change. Bring those solutions to your bosses and peers.
>
> **\> ADOPT A SIDE HUSTLE.**
>
> Driving for Uber or selling on Etsy are legitimate ways to earn extra cash. (Just don't forget to report that income to the IRS.) You'll want to make sure that your side gig doesn't infringe on your main gig, Bachenheimer says.
>
> **\> MAKE IT OFFICIAL.**
>
> If you have an outside gig that takes off, you'll want to start treating it more like a business and less like a hobby, Bachenheimer says. Also, think about opening a dedicated bank account and setting up the ability to accept credit card payments. If you take your business seriously, your customers and clients will too.

By **Lauren Keyson** <br/>
> **The Accidental Entrepreneur**
>
> Bruce Bachenheimer, the accidental entrepreneur, is a clinical professor of management and the director of Pace University’s Entrepreneurship Lab. He tells his students that passion is a must for entrepreneurs and that if they don’t yet know what that passion is, they should keep looking. Sometimes it can happen when it’s least expected –and he is a great example of this.
>
> “Passion is very important. When I found a passion for something, whether it was an entrepreneurial venture or something else, it was very important that I pursue it. Where is that passion going to come from? It can come from almost anywhere and at any time. Early on I discovered a passion for Japanese. I found an exchange program and went to college there for a semester. Later, inspired by Thoreau’s Walden, I decided to leave a career on Wall Street and go sailing. And just as Thoreau decided to leave the woods after his path from the cabin to the pond became too worn in, it was time for me to find something else.
>
> “Just over a decade ago I found a passion for teaching and I did whatever it took to get a teaching position without a typical academic background. Examples of my entrepreneurial passion include having started an online financial services company in Australia and a woodworking business in Maryland. With passion it’s very easy to focus all your time and energy and accomplish something.
>
> “When I talk to my students and they don’t know what their passion is, I tell them it’s fine –wait and keep looking, don’t just settle. I lost the desire for my job as a Wall Street trader and was basically just going through the motions. It was exciting and paid a lot of money, but I knew I wanted to do something else, I just didn’t know what at the time. When you don’t have passion, you can’t force it on yourself. I think it’s a mistake. But keep that radar open and try a lot of different things because you never know where your passion will come from. Sometimes that passion can last a lifetime. For me, some things run their course after a couple of years.”[![]

>
> Bruce Bachenheimer, the executive director of the Entrepreneurship Lab at [Pace University](http://companies.bizjournals.com/profile/pace-university/148181/) in New York, underscores the critical role that hiring the right staff plays in a company’s success.
>
> “In this highly-competitive globalized economy, with rapid technological innovation, firms can no longer view HR as ‘finding square pegs for square holes’ based on a standardized job description and qualifications document,” he says.
>
> Moreover, Bachenheimer notes that many companies make quick judgments about resumes, often overlooking appealing candidates who may have graduated from community colleges or lack Ivy League credentials.
>
> “A holistic assessment based on a broad range of cognitive and emotional traits could offer a much more reliable indicator, but would be very difficult, if not impossible, to administer without AI,” he notes.
>
> Nonetheless, Bachenheimer notes that even hiring by AI has its limitations. “AI is not magic,” he says. “It’s computer programming based on algorithms and training sets input by people. Companies creating and using AI must rigorously test results for accuracy and reliability.”

> At a basic level, entrepreneurship comes down to ventures that turn an idea into a profit. But even that feels like it’s missing something. Entrepreneurship is an umbrella word; it covers so much at one time. In my opinion, Bruce Bachenheimer, a clinical professor of management and executive director of the Entrepreneurship Lab at Pace University, defines it best. He said, “Entrepreneurship is much broader than the creation of a new business venture. At its core, it’s a mindset, a way of thinking and acting.”

**Shoptiques: Can the websites for independent boutiques keep growing?** <br/>
May 30, 2017 <br/>
By **Gary M. Stern** <br/>
> **Thinking like a partner**
> 
> Once a boutique joins the network, Vidisheva expects it to operate and think like a “partner.” While boutiques are permitted to maintain their own site, most don’t.
> 
> Bruce Bachenheimer, executive director of the Entrepreneurship Lab at Pace University in New York, said Shoptiques’ rapid growth suggests that it “must be offering the boutiques it serves a real value proposition.” Moreover, exclusivity with Shoptiques provides an “ability to participate in the network, which should provide additional revenue,” he noted.
> 
> However, its growth has its pitfalls. If shoppers sense that by entering Shoptiques it’s “just being directed through a conglomerated chain of stores rather than discovering a special boutique,” it could lose its charm and pizzazz.
> 
> Hence Bachenheimer concluded, “If they can successfully consolidate this fragmented market segment, they will likely build a profitable and scalable business.” But in order to sustain their dominant position, Shoptiques must “develop a distinct and trusted brand that is widely recognized by boutiques and shoppers,” he said.

> **Expansion challenges**
>
> Many independent retail stores including Chinese restaurants, barber shops and nail salons haven’t “effectively developed a business model to consolidate these fragmented industries,” explained Bruce Bachenheimer, executive director of the Entrepreneurial Lab at Pace University in New York. “The most common reason behind consolidation is economies of scale,” he said.
>
> Moreover, he noted the restaurant business is challenging for individual entrepreneurs to expand. “The restaurant business is extremely competitive and subject to numerous trends and fads. It’s hard enough to manage one, much more complex to keep five thriving,” pointed out Bachenheimer.
>
> Sustaining a loyal staff is another hurdle. “Aside from external factors such as competition and changing trends, high employee turnover is a challenge, attracting, retaining and motivating staff is difficult,” he asserted.
>
> Having several eateries in one location is a way to attract, not discourage, more patrons. “Think about Chinatown or Little Italy,” Bachenheimer pointed out. “Larger numbers of people are interested in going there than would otherwise go to multiple diverse locations,” he said.

These are workers with the industry experience, contacts and ability to start a business. But access to health insurance, especially if they or a family member could be turned down because of a pre-existing condition, can play a major role in whether or not to start a business.

> After spending billions on acquisitions that stoked its downstream business of making parts for the aerospace, automotive and other markets, Alcoa will spin the unit off into a new company, Arconic, later this year. The thinking: investors are not putting a high enough price tag on Arconic’s fast-growing downstream operations because they perceive Alcoa to be a commodity aluminum producer plagued by global overcapacity and depressed metals prices.

> “It’s hard for investors to get excited about that, particularly when commodities prices are falling,” said Bruce Bachenheimer, executive director of Pace University’s Entrepreneurship Lab.

> Those challenges notwithstanding, Mr. Bachenheimer believes corporate divorces are generally more productive than marriages. He said that too often companies pursue a merger or acquisition for the wrong reason: to grow just for the sake of growing.

**Why Some Companies--No Matter How Successful--Should Stay Private** <br/>

By **Jeremy Quittner** <br/>
> Freed from the demands of public market investors who tend to focus on short-term returns, some companies may find renewed life that harks back to when they were small and privately held, business experts say. They can strengthen their brands, double down in the communities in which they operate, and get back to their roots as innovators.
>
> "\[Krispy Kreme\] could take an approach to the business that is more family-friendly and more small-business friendly when you don't have the pressure of quarterly returns," says Bruce Bachenheimer, a clinical professor of management at Pace University in New York.
>
> It's not inconceivable that Krispy Kreme would go public again, Bachenheimer says, as time off the public market can increase the company's cachet and value.
>
> "For the employees and for the primary stakeholders, the distributors and retailers they are associated with, it could be taking a smaller business, longer-term approach" that could help increase the brand's value, Bachenheimer says.

> While Olive Garden is a giant chain, its lessons could be instructive to small business owners. Namely, you should indeed sweat the small stuff, because even minor details akin to a free bread policy can make a big difference to your bottom line.
>
> "When you talk about a company or an industry with very thin margins, tiny changes can have an enormous impact," says Bruce Bachenheimer, a clinical professor of management at Pace University.
>
> The history of business is filled with second chances stemming from minor changes. Many years ago, the company that produces Angostura bitters doubled its sales by widening the size of its bottle opening, which caused consumers to pour more into their drinks. Bachenheimer says. Similarly, some gyms have gotten a revenue boost in recent years simply by adding kettlebells, which tend to appeal to a wider spectrum of gym-goers than traditional dumbbells.
>
> Test changes to products and price points with a limited set of customers, for example, and for a limited amount of time to see how it goes, experts say.
>
> "Call it A/B testing," Bachenheimer says. "It's a nice way to try things on an experimental basis and to measure the results, but not suffer huge consequences if it's not successful."

> Still, some of the findings may be cause for skepticism. [Bruce Bachenheimer](http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/242132-us-must-support-new-entrepreneurial-ventures-to-create), a clinical professor of management at Pace University, disagrees with the point about shorter, non-local names, calling it a red herring. One example of a company that grew from startup phase to gargantuan proportions is Sun Microsystems, whose name, he points out, originally stood for Stanford University Network. And, he says, filing for a patent early on could work against a company because it can be expensive to file for one, or costly to defend against infringement claims.
>
> Bachenheimer agrees with the researchers that the [economic environment](http://www.inc.com/jeremy-quittner/milstein-commission-and-salvaging-the-american-dream.html) has changed dramatically for entrepreneurs, making it much more difficult for young companies to form and grow. One key reason is the decimation of savings and home ownership rates, which both provided much-needed financing to startups in prior decades.
>
> "\[The declining rate of entrepreneurship\] has to do with the financial crisis, wage stagnation, and housing price declines since 2008, and it has to do with the erosion of the middle class," Bachenheimer says.

> The perception of desirability and loyalty to the old-guard of corporations is waning and being replaced with the innovative spirit of the entrepreneur, said Bruce Bachenheimer, clinical professor of management at Pace University and executive director of the school’s entrepreneurship lab.
>
> “A very large percentage of students say they are interested in starting their own company or working at a startup as opposed to the previous generation before, where the goal was to get a job with a big name company,” he said. “Partially that is because of all the changes we have seen in the economy, but also these students have seen their parents laid-off and unemployed and looking for other work, so I think there has been a shift in the mentality.”
>
> In the world of entrepreneurs, the role of accounting has moved beyond bookkeeping to one of critical importance as a strategic role in a company’s positioning for future growth, he said.
>
> Startups looking to raise outside funds from angel and venture investors or who have their eyes on going public or being acquired must manage their books in a tactical way from the get-go, he said.
>
> “The last thing you want to do when you are looking to raise angel money, venture capital money and then ultimately to be acquired or to do an IPO is to have backwards books where you really didn’t know what you were doing and kept a bunch of receipts in a shoebox,” he said.

**Here's How Health Care Could Get Cheaper in 2016** <br/>
February 5, 2016 <br/>
By **Jeremy Quittner** <br/>
> Small companies currently have access to a federal exchange, called SHOP, that leverages their combined purchasing heft to buy plans. But the large company model could percolate down to create an additional option for entrepreneurs.
>
> "What's interesting for small businesses is that similar pools could come from trade unions and trade guilds and business associations," says Bruce Bachenheimer, a professor of clinical management at Pace University. In addition to small companies banding together, Bachenheimer adds that other types of pools also could form, for example within the growing ranks of the self-employed in the so-called gig economy, represented by Uber and TaskRabbit. Even startups that bring together entrepreneurs, such as WeWork, could also present large pooling opportunities.
>
> There are concerns about the sensitivity of data that companies exchange and how they use it, Bachenheimer says, as well as whether these pools will really provide cost savings, as the WSJ suggests. Further, regional nonprofit co-ops that have relied on more limited networks of health care providers have struggled to remain solvent over the years, in large part because they have attracted a preponderance of older workers who need more care.
>
> Yet cooperative networks that service startups would tend to have younger workers, and could have a better chance.
>
> "It will never make economic sense until younger, healthier employees join in," says Bachenheimer. "These plans could be catered to young, tech workers."

**Walmart to Vendors: Give Us a Discount** <br/>
September 28, 2015 <br/>
By **Jeremy Quittner** <br/>
>“To do business with a company like Walmart, vendors are really pushed to the maximum of what they can do,” says Bruce Bachenheimer, a clinical professor of management at Pace University in New York.
>
>**1. Consider a currency hedging strategy.**
>
>It makes sense, if you’re manufacturing overseas and paying for things using local money, to get a handle on costs by protecting against currency swings. One way to do that is by purchasing a currency contract, known as a hedge, that allows you to exchange dollars into the local currency, but at a fixed price and at a predetermined time in the future. 
>
>You benefit if the value of the local currency goes up, but not necessarily when it drops in value. With the strong greenback in recent months, you’re likely to feel some pain. But here’s an additional thing to be wary of, Bachenheimer says: If the currency you’ve hedged decreases in value, and the retailer you supply also asks for a price concession, you’ll take a double hit to your bottom line. 
>
>**2. Create more flexibility in your overseas production.**
>
>While that’s not as easy at it sounds, you could explore adding in other countries that peg their currency to the dollar. That includes many Caribbean nations, suh as Barbados, Antigua, and Belize, Bachenheimer says.

> While most may see the recent Chinese stock market collapse as an indicator of economic despair, some business experts see it as a golden opportunity for Westchester and Fairfield County firms.
>
>Bruce Bachenheimer, a clinical professor of management at Pace University and the executive director of Entrepreneurship Lab — a Lubin School of Business networking and development program — said now is as good a time as ever for local companies to explore opportunities for partnerships and strategic alliances with Chinese companies.
>
>“If I was a Chinese firm and saw this going on, I wouldn’t want to have all my eggs in one basket,” he said. “New York City is the financial capital of the world, and there is a lot of talent here in Westchester County and Fairfield County. I see it as an opportunity for small firms to do business.”
>
>Despite China having the second largest economy in the world after experiencing accelerated growth in recent years, the Shanghai Stock Exchange has been on a downward slump for much of the summer.
>
>Aug. 24, now widely known as “Black Monday” in the financial world, saw the Shanghai main share index lose 8.49 percent.
>
>Calling the U.S. a safe haven economy, Bachenheimer said Westchester’s standing as a wealthy county with large amounts of intellectual capital make it a desirable destination for Chinese companies. Investments in the tech industry would help these firms diversify.
>
>Investors in Westchester, he said, can do one of two things: buy from China, where products and services are less expensive, or conversely, sell to Chinese companies. The selling opportunities, he said, are plentiful in a big market where specialty products may not be impacted by the shrinking Chinese growth rate.
>
>At roughly $10 trillion in gross domestic product, the Chinese economy is still the second largest in the world and has been growing at a very rapid rate for decades. Though the rate is slowing now, it continues to grow. The latest crash does not mean a direct negative impact on Westchester’s small businesses, Bachenheimer said.
>
>“I think, if anything, the Chinese stock market crisis provides more opportunities than stability does,” Bachenheimer said. “They should take these market jitters as an opportunity, not a reason to withdraw into a shell. The Chinese symbol for crisis is the same symbol for opportunity.”

By **Jeremy Quittner**<br/>
>
>Her record at Hewlett-Packard, which she led form 1999 until 2005, is controversial at best. Under her leadership, the company’s share price decreased by more than half, she oversaw the layoffs of tens of thousands of employees, and she engineered a merger with computer maker Compaq that resulted in an ugly public feud with Hewlett family members. Fiorina was also ultimately fired by the computer company’s board.
>
>With those things in mind, Fiorina’s strategy then, as now, is closest to something called agency theory, says Bruce Bachenheimer, a clinical professor of management at Pace University in New York.
>
>Loosely defined, it describes the way public shareholders hire agents--such as chief executives--to make decisions for their companies. Sometimes these agents don’t work in the best interests of the company, Bachenheimer says, which could include having a greater appetite for risk than the owners have, because it’s not really their money at stake. And that appetite for risk sometimes increases as a company underperforms, because the agent’s skin in the game--such as stock options--are worth less. So it can cause an agent to aim for the bleachers, in an all or nothing strategy.
>
>“For Carly Fiorina, it was worth taking a risk \[in the debates\], because the consequences would have been death by a thousand cuts, and becoming completely marginalized,” Bachenheimer say. “By attacking Donald Trump, she could get to five or seven percent in the polls.”

>"It's often difficult to recognize a bubble while you're in it, as unreasonable optimism and speculative greed lead to the belief that a 'new paradigm' will validate wildly aggressive projections," said Bruce Bachenheimer, clinical professor of management at Pace University and executive director of its Entrepreneurship Lab. "It certainly appears that certain sectors of the market are due for a major correction," he said.

**Pommes Frittes tries to rebuild with a little help from Uber-competitor Gett**<br/>

>[Bruce Bachenheimer](http://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/search/results?q=Bruce%20Bachenheimer), executive director of the Entrepreneurship Lab at Pace University, says the rise of the Internet is fostering these co-marketing ventures. “When your only options to promote such partnerships were expensive television, radio or newspaper ads, it wasn’t really a viable proposition,” he says.
>
>With the Internet and social media, companies can join forces and avoid spending expensive marketing dollars.
>
>Moreover, corporate social responsibility is playing a more potent role in consumer choices. When Toms shoes donated a free pair of shoes to the disadvantaged for every pair of shoes bought, it inspired confidence in the company and boosted business.
>
>But some of these partnerships are “publicity stunts” and antagonize customers, acknowledges Bachenheimer.
>
>In the case of Pommes Frites’ disaster, the circumstances were so “out of control, along the lines of an act of God,” that it warranted a charitable outpouring, hints the Pace University professor. Hence, Pommes Frites was considered a worthy recipient for Gett’s assistance.
>
>This partnership could generate attention and business for Gett, which faces a very competitive market in going head-to-head versus Uber and Lyft. Most for-profit businesses assist non-profits, not profitable enterprises, but this situation is a special one.
>
But Pommes Frites may benefit long after the check is cashed. “It should build brand awareness for a restaurant that many probably didn’t hear of,” Bachenheimer asserts.

>Talk about value creation. Sounds like a lofty topic, but even the youngest kids can understand value. "Entrepreneurship is really about opportunity and value creation - the ability to recognize, analyze and capture opportunity in order to create value by solving problems or providing benefits,” says Bruce Bachenheimer, clinical professor of management and executive director of the [Entrepreneurship Lab](http://www.pace.edu/elab) at Pace University in New York. "This is important for kids to learn because jobs, and more importantly meaningful careers, are much less about ‘Tell me what to do and I will do my best to accomplish it' and more about ‘What can you do for me?' - i.e., how can you create value by capturing opportunity in this position. Focus on recognizing opportunities, discussing how to analyze them, and seeing if there is some way to test how to capture them by trying some aspect of the idea in the real world.”

**US must support new entrepreneurial ventures to create jobs and remain competitive**<br/>
May 15, 2015<br/>
By **Bruce Bachenheimer** 
>
>During National Small Business Week, Sen. Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii), a member of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, introduced [legislation](http://www.hirono.senate.gov/press-releases/during-national-small-business-week-hirono-introduces-legislation-to-help-hawaii-small-businesses-get-started-and-grow-green-jobs) to help small businesses in Hawaii and across the country grow and succeed.
>
>The United States needs to support new entrepreneurial ventures in order to create jobs, sustain innovation and remain competitive in a global economy. But lumping small business owners and innovative entrepreneurs in the same category will only serve to mask the problem.
>
>Small business and entrepreneurship is not synonymous. Small businesses are certainly an important part of our economy, but they are quite different than high-growth entrepreneurial start-ups.
>
>Small business is not the engine of job growth. The prevailing belief to the contrary is appealing to populist policy makers and small business advocates, but is not supported by analytical research.
>
>Census data demonstrates that young firms, those one to five years old, are responsible for about two-thirds of job creation (Kauffman 2014). And this is not a new phenomenon. David L. Birch studied 5.6 million businesses between 1969 and 1976 and found that two-thirds of net new jobs were created by firms with twenty or fewer employees. Perhaps more importantly, he found that approximately 80 percent of those jobs were created by firms four years old and younger (‘The Job Generation Process' 1979). While entrepreneurial ventures generally start small, they are intended to scale rapidly. Small businesses generally stay small in support of the owner’s lifestyle.
>
>Small businesses are often founded as an alternative to traditional employment, sustaining a level of income for its founders. An independent contractor, solo-professional, mom-and-pop shop, and family business are examples. Some of these certainly grow to become very large firms that create a significant number of jobs, but those are the exception.
>
>Entrepreneurship is the ability to recognize, analyze and capture opportunity in order to create value by solving problems or creating a bundle of benefits. The three key elements that distinguish an entrepreneurial venture from a small business are a truly new business innovation, a basis of sustainable competitive advantage, and an inherently scalable business model.
>
>High-growth entrepreneurial ventures are needed to transform the economy. A large number of small businesses does not translate into job creation, commercial innovation and national economic competitiveness. With only 3.8% of adults engaged in early-stage entrepreneurial activity, Japan is ranked among the least entrepreneurial economies in the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) 2014 Global Report. It is, however, often referred to as a ‘nation of shopkeepers’ (i.e. small business owners), which may explain why it has been in a recession for more than two decades. The nation’s economic success in the 1970s and 80s was largely due to manufacturing efficiencies, which were eventually competed away to the consumer in the form of lower prices. In the end, innovation is the only basis of sustainable competitive advantage.
>
>Unfortunately, for the past 30 years business startups have been steadily declining in the United States (US Census). This is likely due to financing difficulties and a sharp decline in average household net worth, which fell 48% for those under 30 since 2007 (Pew 2014).
>
>SBA guaranteed loans can help small businesses, but will not significantly spur the growth of entrepreneurial start-ups. These firms need private equity investments, something President Eisenhower recognized in 1958 when he signed the Small Business Investment Act, a time when public support for venture capital to promote American innovation was galvanized by Sputnik.

>People assume that studying entrepreneurship automatically means you're planning to go into business for yourself. In fact, early on, many questioned whether business schools could even teach entrepreneurship or if the required talents were innate. But today, many employers look favorably at the study of entrepreneurship. After all, companies need people who know how to grow a business.

> With hundreds of military veterans enrolled, Pace University places considerable importance on being responsive to veteran needs.  The Entrepreneurship Lab or eLab run by Bruce Bachenheimer is a case in point. 
>
> Thanks to a $50,000 grant they received from the Blackstone Charitable Foundation for veteran entrepreneurial initiatives, the eLab runs boot camps to provide veterans with the critical skills they need to pursue entrepreneurship. Pace was one of only six organizations nationwide to receive such a grant out of 200 plus applicants. Needless to say, they feel quite honored by their selection and have a special commitment to the programs they are running for veterans.
>
> “Blackstone is obviously a very prestigious name and they’re doing some important work,” Director of the Pace University Entrepreneurial Lab Bruce Bachenheimer said in an interview. “It’s great to have been selected by them in a competitive process.”
>
> “We don’t just want to take their skills and transition them into the workforce; we want to get them thinking and acting entrepreneurially,” Bachenheimer said. “It’s about unleashing the entrepreneurial mindset, discovering it, and harnessing it.”
>
> Bachenheimer, along with Associate Director Nikhil Kalyankar, teach the courses. Bachenheimer focuses on fundamentals such as marketing, strategy, and entrepreneurship while Kalyankar teaches technical hands-on courses that ground veterans in the current technology that they can apply to their specific business venture.
>
> “For me personally, when I saw the opportunity to provide a service to those who served, it was really rewarding,” Bachenheimer said.

>Bruce Bachenheimer, the executive director of [Pace University](http://www.forbes.com/colleges/pace-university-new-york/)’s Entrepreneurship Lab, says that he’s seeing more and more startup businesses that are incorporating a face-to-face element.
>
>“We are social animals by nature,” says Bachenheimer.
>
>In the past, entrepreneurs (outside of dating companies) were hesitant to include a real-life element in startups. Putting people together offline can be messy, and potentially dangerous. It’s hard to give 100% assurance that a driver isn’t going to rob his customer or that a temporary guest isn’t going to smash the place up. But that has been the case for taxis and hotels for decades.
>
>It’s also challenging to scale something that requires human interaction. It’s easier to attract millions of people to click on your website than it is to convince millions of people to share their cars or their homes.
>
>“But now that someone has done it, other people see that it can work,” says Bachenheimer. “Companies like Uber and Airbnb created a perception of feasibility.”
>
>And that hard work put into securing drivers, landlords and chefs pays off in stickiness. Bachenheimer says that once people have committed to a company, it’s less likely they will jump ship to a competitor.

>"The one thing that impresses me is that when the person making the pitch has this idea... \[The judges\] don’t seem to be too thrilled with the idea or think it's a cool idea. But then, if they ask about sales or profitability and the person does in fact have real sales and decent profitability, they're like sharks in a feeding frenzy. They want to be part of it," said Bachenheimer. "Even when they didn’t think the idea was cool, when they're able to prove to them that there's real traction, real sales and real profit; they were very interested."

> In his book, Walden, Henry David Thoreau wrote, “I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.”
>
> Bruce Bachenheimer, a former derivatives trader for Westpac Banking Corp., said the book and that quote resonated with him, so much so that years after reading it, he felt compelled to leave a well-paying job on Wall Street to go sailing for two years—about the same amount of time Thoreau spent in the woods surrounding Walden Pond.
>
> “That quote stuck in my mind. I knew that whatever I was doing, I wanted to do it deliberately,” Bachenheimer says.
>
> Bachenheimer sailed from New England, through the Caribbean, to South America for two years on a 36-foot Pearson Cutter sailboat that he named “Deliberate.”  He then lived on the boat for another three years, though he kept it docked in Annapolis, Md., where he had found a job training companies how to use a new firearms fingerprinting system.
>
> Bachenheimer says it wasn’t that he was unhappy at Westpac, or even at the Bank of Tokyo, where he had worked previously. He liked trading, he found the process interesting and he was making good money.
>
> “I was an officer at the bank, right on Broadway between Wall Street and Pine Street. It was the 1980s. It was an exciting time to be working on Wall Street,” Bachenheimer says.
>
> But something was missing. He didn’t feel like he was living his life to the fullest. His mother had died of cancer a few years earlier, an event he says only reminded him of the fragility of life.
>
> “In hindsight, my mother’s death may have had more of an effect on me than I thought at the time,” he says. “But that poem had always had an impact on me. Living deliberately. It hit home the way 9/11 made people pursue things they were passionate about.”
>
> Now a management professor at Pace University and director of their entrepreneurship program, Bachenheimer is among those who decided to forgo a large Wall Street salary to pursue a passion—though in Bachenheimer’s case, his passion was to live life more fully, more consciously. For others, that passion was a career or hobby, like art or woodworking.

November 17, 2014 <br/>
By **Jeanne Gray** <br/>

>
> The panel consisted of angel investor and serial entrepreneur **David Rose**, **Chaz Mee**, a brand innovation strategist and entrepreneur, and **Bruce Bachenheimer**, a Professor and Director at the **Pace University Entrepreneurship Lab**.
>
> Bachenheimer began the evening with a slide presentation of the notable inflection points that have occurred in New York City’s history. He included the 1929 Crash, the City’s virtual bankruptcy in the 1970’s, and the financial crash in 2008. The financial crash directly and adversely impacted the City’s economy which led to changes initiated by the Bloomberg administration.  A new course was set to make the City less dependent on the financial industry which the panel felt contributed to the accelerated growth of the City’s tech startup community.
>
> “After the financial crisis, there has been a greater emphasis on non-financial businesses in the City. Also, technology which was previously limited in scope to technology businesses, now runs across almost all business sectors at one time,” said Bachenheimer. As a result technology is being disruptive on a much wider scale in the New York City economy and fostering broader startup formation.
>
> “Additionally, large companies on the east coast are mimmicking the small work environments of the west coast,” noted Bachenheimer.   Entrepreneur Mee agreed that a shift to a more entrepreneurial culture in large businesses is another indicator that the City’s tech ecosystem is becoming more similar to Silicon Valley.
>
> Bachenheimer’s slide presentation listed the important elements necessary to spawn high growth ventures. The top three listed were a trained workforce, formal and informal diverse networks, and education in entrepreneurship.  All areas that the panel felt New York City has shown depth.

> Through the application, “we understand what students are looking for and match them up with other students interested in doing something similar,” said Bachenheimer.
>
> In addition to the video studio and private meeting room, the eLab has “a 3-D printer, poster printers and Alienware high-speed computers that are great for 3-D modeling and video editing,” Bachenheimer added.
>
> Bachenheimer describes the facility as an ideal environment for anyone to conceptualize, test and launch a business concept. “There’s the space, there’s the equipment and there’s the people,” he said, identifying graduates in the engineering, finance and computing fields that work within the lab.
>
> Bachenheimer warns that “this idea of going to look for a job is a problem. It’s no more, like a generation ago, that you just get hired. Almost all net new jobs are being created by small companies, less than 4 years old with under 100 employees.”
>
> No matter what your occupation, “it’s about recognizing opportunity and creating value,” Bachenheimer stressed. “Pace University’s motto is Opportunitas and nothing is more synonymous with opportunity than entrepreneurship.”

Hustling to start your own company is the new “sexy.” People want The Social Network\-type success rather than Bonfire of the Vanities excess.

October 1, 2014 <br/>
> Even though some people argue that entrepreneurship cannot be taught, business schools are giving it their best shot with programs aimed at helping students launch startups. Actually, while most of the coursework is targeting those who want to be their own boss, some programs are also offering general management training and introduction to an entrepreneurial mindset, which can be applied to traditional jobs.

>"These skills are important not only for those seeking to establish a new venture, but are increasingly critical in a wide variety of professional careers given today's hyper-competitive marketplace, where rapid technological innovation and globalization has led to corporate downsizing and a dramatic change in the very nature of work," says Bruce Bachenheimer, clinical professor of management and director of the Entrepreneurship Lab at Pace University.

> Here's a story of a Life Hacker, someone who plays many games in life and is an awesome human being as well. We met Professor Bruce Bachenheimer when we prelaunched the FreshBiz workshops in New York City and one of our partners had set up a morning meeting for us.
>
> Bruce started out as a successful Wall Street trader. He remembers the first time he did a trade for a billion dollars in one clip. Everyone viewed him as hugely successful. The sensible thing for him to do would have been to continue making money on Wall Street and live the American Dream. But Bruce, an entrepreneurial thinker, had other plans. Reading Walden; or, Life in the Woods by Henry David Thoreau led him to realize how uninspired he was. He felt that doing more of the same for money and prestige lacked purpose and pleasure. He left his job, bought a boat, learned to sail, and spent the next seven years sailing. He even named his 36-foot yacht Deliberate from a passage in Thoreau's book. It was his reminder always to live life deliberately, with choice, power, and conviction.
>
> He explained to us how much he loves living the type of life where anything could happen next. This is exactly what we mean by New Entrepreneurz, Life Hackers, and Gamers who play multiple games. We'd love to see more professors like Bruce inspiring students and entrepreneurs through their real-life know-how and not just through classroom knowledge.

June 9, 2014 <br/>
By Anne Field <br/>
> Meanwhile, as in the nation as a whole, median household income in the New York area has declined recently. As a result, these consumers are watching their pennies—and the companies serving them are feeling it. “The middle-class income squeeze is definitely hurting small businesses,” said Bruce Bachenheimer, clinical professor of management and director of the Entrepreneurship Lab at Pace University.
>
> The situation is particularly acute in New York. “Because of the high cost of living in general in New York, you see these pressures on the middle class even more,” said Mr. Bachenheimer.

> Facebook is reaching out to small businesses with a series of summer boot camps designed to load them with expert advice on how to become successful. Of course, part of that advice includes "advertise on Facebook." This "could really pay off, both in terms of additional revenue and driving interaction between small businesses and their customers on Facebook," said business prof Bruce Bachenheimer.

>
> "A big bulk of small businesses are people who don't use Facebook or only use it casually, so they wouldn't know how to use it to promote a business," he told the E-Commerce Times.
>
> "They are a potentially huge, untapped market, and by investing a small amount of money in educating people and training them how to use it -- hand-holding them on how to use it -- it could really pay off, both in terms of additional revenue and driving interaction between small businesses and their customers on Facebook," Bachenheimer explained.

> 10\. Find Your Passion: We’ve all heard others described as never having worked a day their lives -- figuratively, of course. Why can’t that be us? The work week doesn’t have to be drudgery; it can actually be fun. You just have to find something you love and leave the less important stuff – exorbitant riches, perhaps – behind. Ultimately, passion is what will help us make it through the tough times that inevitably wait ahead. “If you haven’t found your passion, keep looking, don’t try to force something on yourself or settle for what might be of interest,” Bachenheimer says. “Keep looking for new opportunities and experiences, expand your network, keep your radar on, and don’t settle!”

"This is coming from the bottom up," said Bruce Bachenheimer, director of the Entrepreneurship Lab at Pace University.

> Bruce Bachenheimer, a professor of management at Pace University and director of its Entrepreneurship Lab, said the White House effort "is a not so thinly veiled attempt to get younger and healthier Americans to register for Obamacare."

> Bachenheimer said this latest effort is in the same vein as President Obama's recent appearance on Between Two Ferns, a Web-based video show with Zach Galifianakis, on the FunnyOrDie website.
> 
> Bachenheimer said the term geeks "may still be perceived with a somewhat negative connotation and not broadly associated with entrepreneurs in general. Meaning an entrepreneur would be the business leader that makes the decision to get coverage, while the geek may be the employee that expects to have coverage at the start-up he or she works for.

> "I really believe Marshall McLuhan was right when he said 'the medium is the message.' "A canned infomercial on WhiteHouse.gov is not the right medium -- think viral," Bachenheimer said.

> Motivated by a desire to get ahead in their careers or pivot into new ones, they bring tremendous drive to their studies, say professors who work with them. “People of typical college age might be going through the motions. Adult students are determined,” says Bruce Bachenheimer, 53, who runs the Entrepreneurship Lab at Pace University in New York (and went back to school for an MBA just before he turned 40).
>
> Embrace Being a Novice Work experience can be a powerful advantage, especially if you’ve road tested what you are studying, notes Bachenheimer. Nonetheless, you’re there to learn—not prove your expertise as you would at work. Giving yourself permission to not know the course material before you walk in the door can help you relax and keep pace with younger students who, without feeling the need to prove their authority, just dive in.
> 
> Socialize Your Own Way Joining study groups with fellow students or showing up for career networking activities can help you get more out of any academic program, but it can be tricky for midlife students to navigate other opportunities to socialize.

**The Perils of Starting a Business On Your Own** <br/>
January 16, 2014 <br/>
By **Elaine Pofeldt** <br/>
> Myopia is another hazard. Without constant reality checks from a co-founder, it's easy to fall in love with your own plans and waste resources on bad ideas. Setting up an active advisory board of startup veterans can help you avoid that trap, says Bruce Bachenheimer, a management professor who runs the Entrepreneurship Lab at Pace University. He's talking about the kind of people who will ask in-your-face questions that you--and, later, your employees--might be afraid to pose, such as: "Why are you putting all your time into this?" "How come we're not going after a different client?" "Shouldn't we be raising our prices and investing in infrastructure?

**Young American Entrepreneurs Abroad** <br/>
November 25, 2013 <br/>
> To provide perspectives on entrepreneurial opportunities abroad, we spoke with [Bruce Bachenheimer](http://appsrv.pace.edu/lubin/faculty/departments/showFacultyDetail.cfm?Name=Bruce%20Bachenheimer), clinical professor of management and director of the entrepreneurship laboratory at Pace University in New York, and Katie Davies, senior director of consulting services for High Street Partners, which provides consulting services for international business expansion and operations. Bachenheimer set the stage for our discussion with a parable: “Most who visit an emerging country with high poverty rates only see people with no shoes. Entrepreneurs see an opportunity to sell shoes.” Bachenheimer knows what he is talking about. He went to Australia on a scholarship in 1999 to get his MBA and started a business in his spare time. That business – Stock Central Australia – quickly became the third-largest finance site in Australia and was valued at US$1 million after just one year. He also left his job on Wall Street to sail the Caribbean for a few years, found a partner on the island of Trinidad and started another business importing teak lumber to the United States.
>
> We asked Bachenheimer what the best start-up opportunities are for Americans. “I see a couple of different paths to success for young Americans thinking about starting a business in a new country,” he said. “The first one – and the largest opportunity – is leveraging family or other connections you have in your new country. Very often Americans return to their country of origin or a country where they have spent a lot of time and built up a network of connections. Most often, they set up a business they can bring from the U.S. that does not exist in that country. The second opportunity is what I call ‘opportunistic entrepreneurship.’ I happened to be in Trinidad while sailing the Caribbean and saw an opportunity that had great potential. It turned out to be a great business. The third opportunity is the intentional or deliberate path. For example, China is huge and growing, which is attracting many entrepreneurs who see great potential for new businesses.”

>
> Bachenheimer says that young American entrepreneurs are not moving abroad because of the lack of opportunities at home, but rather are satisfying their desire for an adventure, to experience new cultures and have a chance to live in another country.
>
> Bachenheimer pegs the average age of tech entrepreneurs at 39 and agrees that technology businesses are generally U.S.-based and interested primarily in expanding into new global markets. “International entrepreneurs are definitely younger, free to travel and take risks,” he said. “Those entrepreneurs expanding into other countries, though, tend to be a little older because they have already set up businesses in the U.S. and have the money to expand into new markets.”
>
> Which countries are best for entrepreneurs? Bachenheimer says the United Kingdom, Chile, Ireland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand all have aggressive entrepreneurial programs.
>
> How can young American entrepreneurs improve their chance of start-up success? “I would highly recommend that they do their homework,” Bachenheimer says. “What are the country’s immigration laws as they pertain to working and starting a business? What are the employment rules? What are the tax rules? Do your due diligence thoroughly.”

The center was opened in 2012, and it intends to support the school’s entrepreneurship classes by offering services and events, and to bring together Pace’s schools of arts and sciences, education computer science, business, and health. When speaking to BizEd, the director of the eLab, Bruce Bachenheimer, observed that the eLab has worked with students who wanted to develop new educational technologies to teach STEM subjects to high school students, and nursing students who want to develop mobile apps.

> Embracing an interdisciplinary purpose brings a sense of excitement to a business school and its entrepreneurial center, says Bruce Bachenheimer, who directs the Entrepreneurship Lab (eLab) at Pace University’s Lubin School of Business. Opened in February 2012 in a building near New York City Hall, eLab’s purpose is not only to augment the school’s entrepreneurship curriculum with events and services, but also to bring together the schools of business, arts and sciences, health professions, education, and computer science and information systems in cross disciplinary problem solving.
>
> “I recently met with education students who want to develop new educational technologies to teach STEM subjects to New York City high school students—they call themselves ‘edupreneurs,’” says Bachenheimer. “We’re working with nursing students to help them collaborate with computer science students to develop mobile apps for the field of gerontology. Bringing together students from different colleges has been exciting.” 
>
> **What Makes a Great Center?**<br/>
> Listen to users. “There’s an old saying, ‘Why give customers what they want when we know what they need?’” jokes Bruce Bachenheimer of Pace University. But he emphasizes that entrepreneurship centers must let users help direct their design. Pace’s eLab is equipped with the latest computer equipment, but it turns out most students “just need big tables, power outlets, fast wi-fi , and a refrigerator.”

**Entertaining Clients? Save Your Money** <br/>
October 9, 2013 <br/>
By **Kathryn Tuggle** <br/>
> "In the 1980s, you couldn't spend enough money," says Bruce Bachenheimer, director of the Entrepreneurship Lab at Pace University in New York. "But today clients are saying, 'Forget the hunting trip, forget the lavish treatment -- just give me a better price."
>
> Client spending -- and the perception of what "acceptable" client spending is -- has evolved over the past decade, Bachenheimer says. The dot-com crash in 2000 inspired companies to re-examine their investment priorities, and after 9/11 companies saw more urgency in preparing for the inevitable "rainy day." The "final straw" occurred most recently in 2008, when businesses were forced to pare down to their most essential operating costs -- and extravagant client treatment just didn't make the cut.
>
> "Nowadays there's just a level of uncomfortability for the giver and the receiver," Bachenheimer says. "If you're rolling out the red carpet for a customer, they're going to assume you have incredibly high margins to do all that spending. They're going to think, 'Oh, he's overcharging everyone -- including me -- in order to afford all this."
>
> Some of them may even start to wonder, "Did I sign this contract because I was effectively bribed?" Bachenheimer says.
>
> With that said, a company's business is much easier to buy than it was just a few years ago, Bachenheimer says.
>
> "American firms spend roughly 10% of their revenue on marketing. That's not a lot, and gifts and entertainment can eat up a lot of that," he says. "But when you start looking at how cheap digital marketing is -- more importantly, how effective it is -- suddenly, spending big money to wine and dine doesn't seem very cost effective, and companies have realized this."
>
> But there are always a few exceptions to the rule, Bachenheimer says.
>
> "Companies need to examine the cost of new customer acquisition and the lifetime value of a customer. If you're forced to compete with a slew of other companies for someone's business, but that relationship will be lifelong, then it's worth the extra expense," he says. "Also, if you're in an industry where your clients are very high net worth individuals, you're not going to get their business by going by their home in Greenwich and sticking a flier under the windshield wiper of their Rolls-Royce."
>
> Another interesting exception is if your client is potentially sitting on the "next big thing," in business, Bachenheimer says.
>
> "Say there's a hot new social media company. It could be just a bunch of kids, but if everyone believes it will be the next Instagram or Twitter, then it's worth getting them on your side," he says.

>
> The director of Pace University's Entrepreneurship Lab in Pleasantville recently discussed the positive impact that Obamacare could have on tech startups with computerworld.com.
>
> Bruce Bachenheimer stated in the article that people often take jobs that they don't want just to obtain health insurance. If the Affordable Healthcare Act lowers insurance premiums, it would make health insurance more accessible and therefore make a tech start up less of a financial risk, according to Bachenheimer.
>
> Bachenheimer went on to say that most people that create tech startups are in their late 30s and not in their 20s. People in that age range are willing to take risks on a business idea, but not necessarily on their health. Since a serious illness or a car accident can't be controlled, some entrepreneurs view the unmanageable risk as too great.

October 3, 2013 <br/>
> A [new article in Entrepreneur](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/228625) discusses the resources at business schools that can help MBA students on the path to starting and developing their own business, and the article features [Pace University’s Lubin School of Business](http://www.metromba.com/school/lubin-school-of-business-pace-university/) as an example
>
> The article says that business schools can benefit student entrepreneurs by providing them with free or reduced cost technology. To illustrate this point, Entrepreneur talked to Bruce Bachenheimer, the director of Pace’s entrepreneurship program, about the Entrepreneurship Lab. The lab is intended to be a space for students to produce innovative ideas and work with others. The lab provides students with an array of technological devices, including a wide selection of computers (desktop, laptop, and tablet), a 3D printer, advanced software programs, a professional-level video studio, and a surface computer.

> Most of the caveats about outright sales apply here, too, and there's something else to bear in mind: Some companies include a "best efforts" clause in their licensing agreements, noting that they'll try to sell as many products as possible. But some companies may interpret that very loosely—if not ignore it altogether. Bruce Bachenheimer, a clinical professor of management and director of the Entrepreneurship Lab at Pace University, gives an example from the gem industry. A conglomerate, he says, may seem keen to license a device that can transform carbon into diamonds—and agree to pay $1,000 for every carat produced. Yet they may take the agreement, "file that in a drawer and never produce a single carat," he says. "They want to control supply."

Bruce Bachenheimer, clinical professor of management at Pace University as well as director of its entrepreneurship program, explains one aspect of why his school's program is so valuable to student startups: “The Entrepreneurship Lab has assembled an impressive collection of technology resources, including high-performance computers, sophisticated software, a professional video studio, a surface computer, and a 3D printer; as well as a wide variety of desktop, laptop and tablet computers.”

> "A relatively short stay in a hospital can bankrupt someone," said Bruce Bachenheimer, a professor of management at Pace University and director of its Entrepreneurship Lab. He said that, anecdotally, he's seen many people who will take a job they don't even care about just to get health coverage. "It's become such an important factor," he said.
>
> The average age of people who create a tech start-up is 39, and not 20-something," said Bachenheimer, despite the famous examples created by people such as Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. On top of that, there are twice as many tech start-up founders who are over the age of 50 as those who are younger than 25, he said.
>
> Entrepreneurs are willing to take on risks, but health care is not a manageable risk, said Bachenheimer.
>
> "There is a big difference between mortgaging your house on something you can control, and risking going bankrupt by an illness because of something you can't control," said Bachenheimer. No one can predict a car accident or a serious illness, he said.
>
> "Entrepreneurs actually don't see starting a business as risky as many people think, because they are so confident in their abilities and their idea," said Bachenheimer. "But they would see going around without health insurance as a risk."
>
> While Obamacare may lead to an increase in start-ups, there's another side to the coin. Once a start-up nears 50 full-time employees -- the threshold for taking on insurance coverage responsibilities under the law -- it might prompt the company to shift people to part-time work and rely more on outsourced contractors, said Bachenheimer.

**3 Smart Ways to Earn Business Credentials Without an MBA** <br/>
September 3, 2013 <br/>
By **Ben Weiss** <br/>
> 1\. **Raise your hand.**. As Professor Bruce Bachenheimer, the program director for entrepreneurship at Pace University's Lubin School of Business, explains, "While experiential learning should be part of a traditional MBA program, it is imperative to those seeking to gain critical business skills independently."
>
> 2\. **Volunteer outside your organization:** Perhaps your current career keeps you so boxed in that you can't find internal volunteer opportunities to refine important skills. As such, you're considering investing in an MBA to facilitate a career change.
>
> Should you decide you don't have the time, finances or direction to do so, Bachenheimer suggests developing meaningful business skills outside your firm with nonprofits or the countless other organizations that would welcome free help.
>
> 3\. **Develop a business (no matter the magnitude):** Many professionals are attracted to an MBA to become qualified as a manager or strategic director. However, Bachenheimer explains there is likely no better way to illustrate managerial, leadership and business operations credentials than jumping in the fire and starting your own business.

**The Accidental Entrepreneur** <br/>
June 21, 2013 <br/>
By **Lauren Keyson** <br/>
> ![](images/image59981.jpg)
>
> Bruce Bachenheimer, the accidental entrepreneur, is a clinical professor of management and the director of [Pace University’s Entrepreneurship Lab](http://www.pace.edu/lubin/departments-and-research-centers/entrepreneurship-lubin/entrepreneurship-lab/). He tells his students that passion is a must for entrepreneurs and that if they don’t yet know what that passion is, they should keep looking. Sometimes it can happen when it’s least expected – and he is a great example of this.
> 
> “Passion is very important. When I found a passion for something, whether it was an entrepreneurial venture or something else, it was very important that I pursue it. Where is that passion going to come from? It can come from almost anywhere and at any time. Early on I discovered a passion for Japanese. I found an exchange program and went to college there for a semester. Later, inspired by Thoreau’s Walden, I decided to leave a career on Wall Street and go sailing. And just as Thoreau decided to leave the woods after his path from the cabin to the pond became too worn in, it was time for me to find something else.
> 
> “Just over a decade ago I found a passion for teaching and I did what it took to get a teaching position without a typical academic background. Examples of my entrepreneurial passion include having started an online financial services company in Australia and a woodworking business in Maryland. With passion it is very easy to focus all your time and energy and accomplish something.
>
> “When I talk to my students and they don’t know what their passion is, I tell them it’s fine – wait and keep looking, don’t just settle. I lost the desire for my job as a Wall Street trader and was basically just going through the motions. It was exciting and paid a lot of money, but I knew I wanted to do something else, just not what at the time. When you don’t have it, you can’t force a passion on yourself. I think it’s a mistake. But keep that radar open and try a lot of different things because you never know where that passion will come from.”
>
> “Sometimes that one passion can last a lifetime. For me, some things run their course after a couple of years.”

> **1\. Shift your focus to attracting other owners.** Bruce Bachenheimer, director of the Entrepreneurship Lab at Pace University, says too many entrepreneurs pitch their business with the mindset of getting investors to help them. But investors want to know what’s in it for them, not what’s in it for you. Your focus should be on attracting other owners “by demonstrating real value creation and an acceptable level of risk and return.”

> [![](images/image5971.png)](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118340477.html) Pace University Professor Bruce Bachenheimer was profiled in Leading the Epic Revolution, a book written by Hunter Muller, which was published by Wiley in 2013. The profile appears on pages 55 to 57 and 221 - 223. The following is an excerpt (the profile may be found at [http://bit.ly/ProfessorOfInnovation](http://bit.ly/ProfessorOfInnovation)):
>
> **Professor of Innovation**
>
> I was recently introduced to Bruce Bachenheimer, Clinical Professor of Management at Pace University’s Lubin School of Business and Director of the University’s Entrepreneurship Lab. I think it’s fair to say that Bruce lives and breathes innovation and entrepreneurship. A serial entrepreneur himself, Bruce is an expert on the important role that innovation plays in business growth.
>
> In a lengthy interview, Bruce outlined some of the reasons he’s passionate about innovation and entrepreneurship. Here’s a brief summary of what he said in the interview:
>
> “As Thomas Friedman says, the world is flat. Countries compete on a much more equal basis that in the past. On a national level, the only sustainable competitive advantages come from innovation.
>
> “Competing on the basis of low labor costs is a temporary strategy. It’s a race to the bottom and it won’t keep you competitive in the long run. Nations with high standards of living, low unemployment, trade surpluses and general prosperity tend to compete on innovation.
>
> “For a while, it seemed like Japan’s strategy of competing on the basis that manufacturing efficiency was a winning strategy, but the gains they achieved disappeared as competition drove down prices, which benefited consumers, not manufacturers. It was a temporary victory, and now they’ve been in a recession for nearly two decades.
>
> “If you look at countries that are leaders in innovation – the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, Israel, and the countries in northern Europe – you see high levels of education and high levels of entrepreneurship. In Japan, for example, the culture and regulatory system make it very difficult for entrepreneurs to succeed. If you are an entrepreneur in Japan, you face a lot of barriers. As a society, Japan is very intolerant of failure. That fear of failure stops people from taking risks, and you need to take risks to succeed as an entrepreneur.
>
> “On the other hand, countries like the U.S. and Israel are much more tolerant of failure – especially when you fail on someone else’s dime. Failure isn’t exactly a badge of honor, but it’s not the end of the world either. In the U.S., when someone’s business fails, people are likely to say, “That guy really learned a lesson. He sure won’t make that mistake again.” People in entrepreneurial cultures tend to see failure as a learning experience.
>
> “Company cultures have a similar impact on innovation. Companies that encourage innovation and tolerate a certain amount of failure are more likely to be the serial innovators.”
>
> I love how Bruce puts innovation and entrepreneurship into context, and shows us the impact of innovation on multiple levels.  Bruce also advises his students to think like innovative entrepreneurs when envisioning their career paths.  In today’s rapidly evolving and ever-changing economy, I think that’s excellent advice for all of us.

December  10, 2012 <br/>
By **Steve Minter** <br/>
>
>"It is incredibly important in today's hypercompetitive environment where technology and the macro-economy are changing so quickly that companies think much more entrepreneurially," says Bruce Bachenheimer, clinical professor of management at Pace University.
>
> **Hearing a Different Drum**
>
> Companies that want to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship, or intrapreneurship, in their ranks must ensure that they provide the right incentives to employees. Too often, Bachenheimer says, companies say they want innovative, entrepreneurial employees but "what they really want is disciplined employees that are polite, respectful, come in well-dressed and are not insubordinate." That isn't necessarily the profile of a creative, strong-willed employee who wants to march to a different drum.
>
> The first thing companies should consider is how they will handle risk and reward. "If you have some really bright, innovative employees, if they take the risk to do something and it doesn't work, is their career derailed?" posits Bachenheimer. "On the other hand, what happens if it is wildly successful, if it saves or makes the company millions and millions of dollars? What kind of reward do those employees get?" The reward doesn't have to be as lavish as a large grant of stock options, he says, but it should be "more than some kind of nominal $1,000 bonus."

> A common frustration for women is that when they’ve done the heavy lifting on executing projects at work, the men on their team seem to score more points with the boss. “Men tend to be much more self-promoting, which helps in corporate America in terms of who is getting ahead and getting attention,” says Bruce Bachenheimer, a professor of management at Pace University.

> Starting your own business can be a way to reap more rewards from your hard work, as Leigh discovered. If you keep customers happy, you’re the one who will see your revenues rise. However, to get clients to pay you what you’re worth, you may have to get better at tooting your own horn to clients, as you would to a boss. “In small business and growing ventures, you have to be out there and say how great you are,” says Bachenheimer.
> 
> **Have you been penalized for needing flexibility?**
>
> The downside to limiting your hours in a small business: If you’re not available when customers need you, you may find there are limits to your success. “At some point, if you decide that your objective is to maximize revenues, then you won’t turn down calls and meetings,” says Bachenheimer.

> Surprisingly, the 2008 financial crisis has been a catalyst for the technological scene in New York. "Many programmers, engineers and analysts have landed in Silicon Alley after losing or leaving their jobs on Wall Street” says Bruce Bachenheimer, director of the Entrepreneurship Laboratory at Pace University in New York. “And it has become sexier to say that you work in a start-up rather than on Wall Street. It is a situation that the mayor understood."

> For the private sector of the economy, QE may not have an entirely a positive effect. Mr. Bachenheimer, who has long been engaged in entrepreneurial studies, stated that as the market stabilizes, it is likely that equities will improve, bond prices will decline slightly, gold will become less attractive, the dollar will strengthen, and start-up enterprises will find it easier to secure debt and raise capital.

> The impact of tech cannot be underestimated. “The city recognised this and knew it needed to do something,” explained Bruce Bachenheimer, clinical professor of management and director of entrepreneurship at Pace University, New York. Money isn't the only answer, however. “You need a strategy,” Bachenheimer said.
>
> Knowing what the private sector needs is also a key. “In the '90s, people were chasing money,” Bachenheimer said. “The saying was that if you could say dot-com you got money. Now people want revenue and profits. If you look at what New York is excelling at, it is not creating some technology, it is taking existing technology and applying it where there is real need.”

> They also question crowd funding's viability, predicting, for example, that communicating with hundreds of mom-and-pop investors—and being second-guessed by them—will turn off many entrepreneurs, not to mention VCs, when the entrepreneurs attempt to attract later rounds of traditional funding. Unsophisticated investors are more likely to buy shares based on exaggerated valuations, the argument goes. To invest in a later round, more savvy angels or venture capitalists would insist on lowering the valuation—which would incur the wrath of the original shareholders. They argue, too, that entrepreneurs who work with amateur investors will miss out on the advice, networking opportunities and tough love provided by VCs and angels, not to mention the stamp of approval a venture investment confers.

The game itself is a very good tool, but not in and of itself — the ‘brilliance’ lies in the abilities of those conducting the exercise.”

While the whole economy is stagnating, NYC companies have received millions in funding.  While we have lagged the nation out of recoveries in the past, we are now ahead — this shows the impact of digital media has had.”

Build straight in the eco-system so that we can make sure this isn’t a bubble, but that it’s something that can last.”

**6 Steps to a Successful Start** <br/>
Summer 2012 <br/>
By **Nancy Mann Jackson** <br/>
>
> **GO BEYOND THE BUSINESS PLAN.**
>
> Planning carefully before launching a new business is not limited to preparing a business plan, says Bruce Bachenheimer, clinical professor of management and director of the Entrepreneurship Lab at Pace University in New York City. “While preparing a business plan is generally a valuable exercise, there are other ways to plan carefully,” he says. Bachenheimer recommends three planning methods.
>
> • The Apprentice Model: gaining direct industry experience, as the founders of Tender Greens did.
>
> • The Hired-Gun Approach: partnering with experts who have in-depth knowledge and experience.
>
> • The Ultra-Lean School of Hard Knocks Tactic: figuring out a way to rapidly test and refine your model at a very reasonable cost.
>
> If you don't commit to in-depth preparation, launching a new business can be a very expensive lesson in the value of planning. Bachenheimer asks: “Would you enter a high-stakes poker tournament without knowing the game, assuming that you'll figure it out as you go?”
>
> **KNOW THE MARKET.**
>
> Ask questions, conduct research or gain experience to help you learn your market inside and out, including the key suppliers, distributors, competitors and customers, Bachenheimer says. “You also have to really understand the critical metrics of your market, whether it's as simple as sales per square foot and inventory turnover, or an esoteric measure in a highly specialized niche market,” he says.
>
> **ESTABLISH CASH RESOURCES.**
>
> To determine how much cash you'll need, develop a cash-flow statement that estimates your expenses and income. Be sure to include appropriate expense levels by researching actual business costs rather than estimating based on your personal experience as a retail consumer. “For instance, you can host your personal website with unlimited bandwidth for $9.95 a month, but operating a commercial website may cost hundreds or thousands of dollars a month,” Pace University's Bachenheimer says.

> Is the private incubator model right for your startup? They both have their pros and cons, but incubators backed by major companies may aid your development into a seasoned entrepreneur at a faster rate, says Bruce Bachenheimer, director of entrepreneurship at Pace University’s Lubin School of Business. "They all bring something unique and different and there certainly are a lot of benefits to the different approaches," he adds. "One thing that the Foundry does that’s special is creating the mindset of an entrepreneur primarily as opposed to just counting the number of startup companies they create."

> One of the latest manifestations of the trend: the February launch, by Pace University’s Lubin School of Business, of an entrepreneurship lab that aims to facilitate collaborations between students in schools as diverse as nursing and business.
>
> “The idea is that it will involve all Pace students and faculty from all the schools,” said Bruce Bachenheimer, director of the lab and of the Lubin’s entrepreneurship program. “We’re stressing an interdisciplinary, hands-on experience to find new ways to solve difficult problems.”
>
> When it comes to harder stuff, such as the ability to recognize opportunities, Pace and other schools use case studies, brainstorming lessons and other exercises to nurture that skill.
> 
> “It’s kind of like teaching music or painting,” explained Mr. Bachenheimer.
>
> Pitch Contests have also proved to be a great way to network and meet investors. The most recent contest at Pace drew an audience of 400, including venture capitalists, angel investors and bankers, said Mr. Bachenheimer.
> 
> And by one definition, entrepreneurship training doesn’t have to result in a business launch to be successful. If a person is trained to size up opportunities and take initiatives, and he and his employer have an edge, said Mr. Bachenheimer.

> “The nature of the work is changing dramatically,” he said. “There’s no more ‘Give me a job and tell me what to do.’”

**FinTech Innovation Lab Makes Wall Street Sexy Again** <br/> 
March 19, 2012 <br/> 
>
> Since Wall Street's profits and prestige have slumped, the best and the brightest are looking elsewhere for jobs, making it harder to lure promising recruits. Bruce Bachenheimer, director of entrepreneurship at Pace University, told Technology Review that in the 1990s it was "exciting and sexy to say you were working on Wall Street."  But that's changed. Those formerly positive perceptions have flipped 180 degrees.

**Wall Street's Search for Innovation** <br/>

By **Erik Sherman** <br/> 
>
> After banking deregulation took off in the 1990s, it became "exciting and sexy to say you were working on Wall Street," says Bruce Bachenheimer, clinical professor of management and director of entrepreneurship at Pace University. Money and prestige helped lure top academic talent, including mathematicians and computer scientists, to hedge funds.
> 
> But that has changed, beginning with 2008 and the financial meltdown. "The perception of working on Wall Street went from positive to negative," Bachenheimer says. Wall Street reached its latest low this week when a Goldman Sachs executive resigned and publicly excoriated the company's ethics in a New York Times op-ed.
>
> Meanwhile, places like Silicon Valley, Boston, and other hotbeds of high tech suddenly look like the most attractive places to be. With the recent spate of Web-company IPOs, technology startups are also potentially a faster ticket to wealth than Wall Street, where bonuses fell 14 percent last year, continuing a multi-year slide.
>
> "Perceptions of desirability are very important in entrepreneurship. \[Technologists\] want to go where the action is and want to be doing cool stuff," says Bachenheimer.

**Bachenheimer now runs E-Lab** <br/> 
February 24, 2012 <br/>
By **Editorial Staff** <br/> 
>
> Pace University’s new Entrepreneurship Lab, known as the E-Lab, now has a CEO –  it’s professor Bruce Bachenheimer of Chappaqua. A clinical professor of management at Pace, Bachenheimer is now also the director of the E-Lab. It is available to all Pace students, in New York City and in Pleasantville.
>
> Bachenheimer will advise all aspiring student entrepreneurs, in everything from accounting and computer science to law and the performing arts.
>
> He came up with the idea for the annual Pace Pitch Contest and Business Plan Competition, which he introduced in 2004, just after joining the Lubin School of Business faculty.
>
> “The Entrepreneurship Lab aims to foster an entrepreneurial mindset – a way of thinking and acting that focuses on developing new ways to solve problems and create value,” said Bachenheimer. “These skills are important not only for those seeking to establish a new venture, but are increasingly critical in a wide variety of professional careers given today’s hyper-competitive marketplace, where rapid technological innovation and globalization has led to corporate downsizing and a dramatic change in the very nature of work.”
>
> Bachenheimer began his career as a Wall Street trader, and then took several years off to sail through the Caribbean to South America. After that, he launched an importing business and then moved into high-tech forensic science before joining Pace.

**Pace University’s Entrepreneurship Lab Will Train People To Think Differently** <br/> 
February 17, 2012 <br/> 
By **Will Wei** <br/> 
>
> Pace University officially opened the doors to its Entrepreneurship Lab (aka, E-Lab) last night, and there to cut the ribbon was Professor Bruce Bachenheimer, who was named the lab’s first director.
>
> “It takes innovation and entrepreneurship to develop things that are meaningful,” Bachenheimer tells us over the phone.
>
> “We don’t measure our metrics by how many students launch businesses,” Bachenheimer says. “It’s the ability to come up with new and creative solutions to problems, and the ability to add value in a unique and innovative way.”
>
> To spur innovation, Bachenheimer and his E-Lab will provide students with workspace for creative thinking, in addition to access to workshops, guest speakers, roundtable discussions, and networking events involving members of the entrepreneurial community.
>
> “If you’re looking at very good innovators, they have to be young enough so that their minds are not so rigid in the way things are and the way things should be,” says Bachenheimer. “But they also need to have enough knowledge, skills, and abilities to find and solve problems.”
>
> To mold a mind into innovative shape, college students need an “experiential education.”
>
> “You need to train people to think differently, and if there are specific skills they don’t have, let them know how to get those resources,” Bachenheimer says. “Hopefully, the Entrepreneurship Lab is one of them.”

**Pace University launches entrepreneur lab** <br/> 
February 15, 2012 <br/> 
By **Emily Laermer** <br/> 
>
> The lab will include space for students to conference with investors, a studio for them to work and a large meeting room for speakers. Bruce Bachenheimer, the director of the lab and a professor at Lubin, says he plans to reach out to some of the thousand-plus Pace-area alums who self identify as entrepreneurs to be potential guests.
>
> “This will be very student focused,” Mr. Bachenheimer said. “It's important for me to see how the students are using the lab and what is providing them with the most value.”
>
> In fact, Mr. Bachenheimer says he has seen an increase in student interest in entrepreneurship in recent years. He blames this on the economy and the high unemployment rate. Students see creating their own companies as a safer route.
>
> “They also want to make something meaningful and create something,” he said.

> But before would-be self-employed moguls get started, they need to look realistically at what they’re hoping to accomplish, said Bruce Bachenheimer, a professor of management and Director of Entrepreneurship at Pace University.
>
> “Do you have a real strategy?  A lot of people in this bad economy see home-based as a way to be employed, fill a gap on the resume or whatever,” he said. “But it’s not as easy as it appears.”
>
> EXPERT ADVICE To start a home-based business:
> 
> SET REALISTIC GOALS “To launch a business does take capital, time and money, and always twice as much as you think,” says Pace University’s Bruce Bachenheimer
>
> FIND A MENTOR Talk to people who have started home-based businesses, join entrepreneur and small business groups, and get feedback about start-ups. “Smart entrepreneurs surround themselves with even smarter experts,” said Bachenheimer.
>
> THINK SALES A lot of people have a romantic vision that working at home means making your own hours and making money.  But the reality is, no matter what you’re offering , you need someone to buy it.  “Entrepreneurs are optimistic by nature, but don’t confuse passion and stubbornness.  You need someone to actually open up their wallet and want,” said Bachenheimer.
>
> BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF Not everyone is cut out to be an entrepreneur. “The best are risk-takers confident in themselves and their ideas,” Bachenheimer says.

> ■ **Crunch the numbers.**
>
> Bruce Bachenheimer, clinical professor of management and director of entrepreneurship at Pace University in New York City, suggests telling the budding entrepreneur you will invest your $50,000 after he or she finds outside investors willing to put up the other $100,000.
>
>These investors “are going to know what a business plan should look like, what the valuation of the business should be and what the privileges of the investors are,” says Bachenheimer.
>
> ■ **Write up the terms.**
>
> It’s critical to document in writing the terms of your loan or equity investment. At a minimum, your document should spell out the amount being invested, how the funds are to be used and how the parent investor will be repaid. Bachenheimer says you can find sample loan documents on the Internet or seek advice from experts at a small business development center.
>
> “Parents usually have a very valuable amount of social capital,” Bachenheimer says. Your accountant, lawyer, banker, business associates or golf buddies could be potential customers, advisers or investors.

**Pitch contests gain popularity**<br/>
September 28, 2011<br/>
By **Amy Buttell**<br/>
>
>The advantage of a pitch competition is that it’s much easier to enter, organize, participate and judge than a typical
>
>business plan competition, which typically encompasses an entire academic year, according to Bruce Bachenheimer, a
>
>professor of management who runs both the Pace University Pitch and Business Plan Competitions.
>
>“Basically, competitors have three minutes in front of a panel of judges to sell their idea,” he says. “There’s an audience
>
>for our competition, who can suggest questions, and who also get an education in entrepreneurship.” Last year, Pace
>
>gave $50,000 in prizes to the competition winners, he says. The pitch competition has become very popular among
>
>business students.
>
>Pitch contests require different skills than business plan competitions. In a pitch contest, you don’t necessarily need to
>
>have the fully-fleshed out idea that you need to succeed in a business plan competition. Instead, as Bachenheimer puts it, competitors need to “have excellent >presentation skills, be quick on their feet, be able to provide a quick summary and be responsive to the very pointed questions of a panel of very >distinguished judges.”
>
>He’s very pleased with the way the pitch competition, which is now in it’s eighth year, has evolved. “In the beginning,
some of the ideas were kind of crazy, but it’s gotten very serious,” he continues. “It’s very educational and very entertaining for the presenters and the audience. It’s a fast-paced, fun learning opportunity for everyone, including the
audience.”
>
>One big advantage of pitch contests is that they are relatively painless to enter. Instead of writing up a complicated, indepth business plan that participants may have to revise numerous times over the months, a simple 500 word or so entry form, a brief biography and a 10-question form are the sole requirements for the Pace Pitch Contest. Not only is it simpler for the contestants, it is also much easier for the judges and organizers, he says.
>
>And that makes it a good selling point for judges, who have to make a big time commitment to judge a business plan competition. Those can take months and judges must read multiple business plans, evaluate them at various stages and mentor competitions. With the pitch competition, it’s a one-day commitment. It’s also much easier on organizers, which is why it’s easier to start and run a pitch competition than a full business plan competition, he continues.

**New York exports its entrepreneurial expertise**<br/>
September 27, 2011<br/>
By **Eilene Zimmerman**<br/>
>
>![BrucePicture](images/BrucePicture.png)
>
>“Although the new semester had barely begun this year at Pace University's Lubin School of Business, Director of Entrepreneurship Bruce Bachenheimer already had teaching requests from groups and institutions in India, China, Norway and Israel.
>
>Mr. Bachenheimer returned from India in early September, spoke to a Chinese delegation at Pace immediately afterward and then taught a course on writing a business plan for students visiting from the BI Norwegian Business School. He will travel to Israel in early January.
>
>Colleges and universities abroad, especially those located in developing nations, are increasingly trying to establish the kinds of entrepreneurship programs that exist here in the U.S.
>
>Generations of immigrants may have fueled American entrepreneurialism, but, according to Mr. Bachenheimer, entrepreneurship education on the college level is primarily an American export. And local professors are seeing the demand for their expertise grow beyond the occasional request to teach overseas while they're on a school break or a sabbatical. Foreign universities are more and more willing to pay a premium for the know-how of professors from entrepreneurship centers such as Silicon Valley, New York City and Cambridge, Mass., the Lubin professor says.
>
>Reflecting the growing international interest in entrepreneurship education, the Bloomington, Ind.-based Global Consortium of Entrepreneurship Centers, whose members are university-based, switched to its current name three years ago, notes Mr. Bachenheimer. Founded in 1996 as a national consortium, the organization made the change in response to interest from international institutions.
>
>Although students obviously can't absorb everything about running a business while in a classroom setting, the fastest way to get started and learn to manage risk is often with the guidance and assistance available through universities and colleges. (Other kinds of structured support can be invaluable as well: Research from the National Business Incubation Association and the U.S. Small Business Administration show that businesses coming out of incubators have a much lower failure rate than that for startups overall, says Mr. Bachenheimer.)

**Is a bigger jackpot better in business plan competitions?**<br/>
September 22, 2011<br/>

>Promoting entrepreneurship is also a goal of the [Pace University Business Plan and Pitch Competitions](http://www.pace.edu/lubin/departments-and-research-centers/entrepreneurship-lubin/pace-business-plan-competition), says Bruce Bachenheimer, clinical professor of Management, who runs both of the competitions. “One of our goals is to encourage an entrepreneurial mindset, which is important in today’s hyper competitive global economy, whether you work in an established business or not.”
>
>The brevity of the university’s Pitch Competition is one reason it attracts a 400 person audience and a substantial number of actual competitors. That’s impossible to accomplish in a business plan competition because of the nature of business plans and the sheer length of the competition.
>
>“The participatory nature of the pitch competition means that it’s benefitting the audience as well as the competitors,” he says. “Everyone gets to hear about the ideas and follow the give and take between competitors and the judges as questions are asked and answered.”

>**Be honest with yourself.** Not everyone is cut out to be an entrepreneur. “The best are risk takers confident in themselves and their ideas,” says Bruce Bachenheimer, a professor of management at Pace University in New York.
>
>Take time to consider what you’re giving up or getting into. Do you need a structured environment? A steady paycheck? “Are you fleeing a boss only to find all customers will be your boss?” Bachenheimer asks. “Are you dumping a time clock but investing 100 hours a week?”
>
>Buying an existing business can be a good route. “Sometimes owners run out of capital or enthusiasm,” Bachenheimer says. “You can get a lot of assets, inventory, and a client base.” Still, he warns buyers to perform due diligence to prevent getting stuck with someone else’s bad debts.
>
>Smart entrepreneurs surround themselves with even smarter experts. Find a financial consultant or lawyer for advice, but choose advisers carefully. “Don’t pay hucksters to do things that are free – like obtaining an employer identification number,” Bachenheimer says. “Anyone can sell themselves as an expert, so get references and proposals.
>
>Once your business has some cash flow, you might find it easier to get a small-business loan, Bachenheimer says.

>“Once you have a mentor, be sure to demonstrate that you value the relationship and are taking affirmative action (i.e. not just saying “thanks” regularly, but really letting the mentor know the efforts are worthwhile).
>
>“Always try to find ways to reciprocate — to demonstrate your gratitude and commitment. Little things that may be of assistance to the mentor can go a long way.”

>**Step 3: Outwit Bad Buyers**<br/>
>Sure, the 80/20 rule – where 80% of your revenue comes from 20% of your clients – applies to almost any distributor, but firing bad customers indiscriminately is a dangerous move, says Bruce Bachenheimer, clinical professor of management at Pace University in New York. For years, experts have suggested small-business owners dump the deadweight. Instead, Bachenheimer says, keep the marginal clients – you never know when a small order or difficult customer might pay off handsomely down the road – but make them turn their drain on your company into a potential profit center.
>
>For example, Bachenheimer says, when electronics retailer Best Buy noticed certain types of shoppers would buy a TV to watch the Super Bowl and return it the next day, the money it cost to service the returns and restock those items was a drain on its profits. So it started charging a restocking fee to discourage customers who had no intention of keeping the products they bought. Distributors might consider imposing fees, for example, for clients that repeatedly demand multiple samples, art proofs, shipping returns and other profit-reducing services.

>“In today’s busy world, with 140-character Twitter \[posts\] and one-paragraph Zagat reviews, everything has to be shorter and persuasive,” says Bruce Bachenheimer, competition founder and director of entrepreneurship at Pace.
>
>Your pitch must also convince investors that you won’t burn through money. “This is the era of the lean startup,” says Bachenheimer. “If the idea costs $1 million, you need to show $100,000 milestones, a working model of how you will get and grow customers to make investors more comfortable.”

>And the winners are …

>The critical requirement, sums up Bachenheimer, is “venture capitalists need to be convinced not only that it’s a good idea, but that you can make it happen. It’s always better to bet on the jockey rather than the horse.”

>Many entrepreneurs have trouble “mixing up stubbornness and arrogance with passion and persistence,” says Pace University professor of management Bruce Bachenheimer. You can’t throw in the towel every time things don’t go your way, but you also can’t ignore circumstances that call for a change in your business plan, no matter how ingenious you may think it is.
>
>Entrepreneurs “just overestimate everything,” says Bachenheimer, citing customer appeal and investor enthusiasm as two areas new business owners typically exaggerate. “They can’t put themselves in other people’s shoes and separate themselves from their own optimism.”
>
>“People underestimate virtually every expense associated with starting and running the business,” says Bachenheimer. He adds that this is particularly true of Web entrepreneurs, who often think a new site can be started with nothing more than a laptop and a $20 domain registration. Actual expenses are exponentially larger.

**Schools add new entrepreneur programs for M.B.A. Students** <br/>
July 21, 2010 <br/>
By **Katy Hopkins** <br/>
> At [Pace University Lubin School of Business](http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/items/01309), opportunity for inspiration sometimes comes from outside the classroom—even outside the country. In "Special Topics in International Entrepreneurship: Technology, Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Israel," Professor Bruce Bachenheimer will take students to abroad in spring 2011 for a week to study opportunities in the young country's advanced technology infrastructure.
> 
> Bachenheimer has taken entrepreneur students to Tanzania and India in years past. These international opportunities often lend a life-changing perspective of business opportunities in other countries, he says. For Pace graduate Melissa Lopez, this revelation came when she saw Tanzanian women selling handmade clothing to tourists at Mount Kilamanjaro.
>
>"It made it pure to see entrepreneurship at a very small level, but \[to see\] how big people's ideas are," Lopez says. "Prior to taking the course, I had never thought I would have any interest in entrepreneurship. I had always thought I'd be working for a large company.
>
> "After that course, I wanted to see if I could do something for myself."
>
> Classes in entrepreneurship are becoming more universally attractive, Bachenheimer says. About 15 percent of students in his entrepreneur classes are M.B.A. students. The rest are students from different academic disciplines who are considering what an entrepreneurial focus could do for their careers, he says.
>
>"They're all [saying], 'I want to be more entrepreneurial. I don't want to just work in an office or count on a job, especially when the economy is bad," Bachenheimer says. "[They say], 'I want to have more control of my destiny."

**How to Market a For-Profit Social Venture** <br/>
July 1, 2008 <br/>
By **Rachel Solomon** <br/>
> The majority of 2,007 customers polled said they were more likely to buy from companies that make energy-efficient products, promote health and safety, and support fair labor practices. That sentiment, however, should not influence your marketing game plan, warns Bruce Bachenheimer, a professor of management and director of the entrepreneurial program at Pace University's Lubin School of Business in New York City. "A lot of people say, 'Yes, I want to buy things that are socially conscious,'" he explains. But "the bottom line — no matter what we consumers say we'd like to do — is that it has to be similar \[to competitors\] in terms of price and ease to purchase."
>
> **Building Your Brand** <br/>
> When it comes to branding, a social enterprise should wear its heart on its sleeve, Bachenheimer says. Your associations with your values become just as important as those with your goods or services. You can inherently brand your values by forming relationships with socially-conscious retailers (think Whole Foods, the natural-foods grocer) who are known for vetting their vendors. A social enterprise's "emotional" branding can also be bolstered by labeling from various certification agencies, such as Fair Trade's FLO International, says Bachenheimer.
>
> **Communicating the Mission** <br/>
> Educating consumers about your social impact is perhaps one of the biggest and most delicate challenges of marketing the enterprise. "When people understand it, they might be willing to go a little bit out of their way and pay a little more money," says Bachenheimer.

By **Ed Rabinowitz** <br/>
> **Business is booming** <br/>
> Young medical school students aren’t the only ones recognizing the importance of an MBA in today’s changing healthcare environment. Professor Bruce Bachenheimer, director of entrepreneurship at New York’s Pace University, says quite a few established physicians are returning part-time at night for their MBA.
>
> “The doctors coming in recognize that insurance and medical billing are making it much more difficult to be a doctor,” Bachenheimer explains. “They’re part of a cog of a much larger wheel, and \[healthcare\] is much more of a business. That has prompted some doctors to say, ‘Let me understand the business so I can play this game better.’”
>
> Some of the physicians Bachenheimer has spoken with don’t want to work directly in medicine, but instead want to use medical training and an MBA to help launch new medical start-ups. Others are interested in wireless medical technology, so they need to be aware of the business side of the equation. And some simply want to take over an existing practice and need to better understand the business aspects that are involved.
>
> “Other doctors are just tired of medicine,” Bachenheimer admits. “I had one family doctor say to me that when patients walk in, he can tell in two minutes what their problem is, and it almost gets mundane. He just wants to do something else.”

> In addition to Uncle Sam's resources, Bruce Bachenheimer, a professor of management and director of the entrepreneurial program at Pace University's Lubin School of Business, recommends contacting like-minded programs from the foreign markets you aim to enter. "Just as the U.S. has all these services to help exporters, virtually every foreign country in the world \[has\] some kind of trade development office," he says.
>
> An international partner can make or break your global endeavor. And finding the right one is not always obvious. "It doesn't mean finding the biggest and the best in the country," Bachenheimer explains. "It's \[about\] finding someone whose interests are most closely aligned with yours."
>
> A database of trade events searchable by country, state, industry and date is available at [export.gov](http://export.gov/). No matter how you find a partner, though, conduct due diligence, Bachenheimer says. "Ask who their customers are, how long they've been in business and seek out their references.”

Winter 2007/2008 <br/>
By **Nathaniel Sheppard Jr.** <br/>
> “A lot of people do a plan because it is a requirement to get money,” said Bruce Bachenheimer, clinical professor of management at Pace University in New York. “The key, though, is to step back and not think of it as something you have to do to get a loan, but something to teach you what you don’t know, something you can use to prove and demonstrate that there is alignment of a business with opportunity and resources.”
>
> Central to a workable plan, Bachenheimer said, are these five steps:
> 1\. Determine what you don’t know, what assumptions need to be tested and what research needs to be conducted;
> 2\. Put it all down on paper in a coherent, complete and convincing style;
> 3\. Focus the plan on the customers’ needs and any critical market conditions, industry dynamics or macro-environmental factors;
> 4\. Demonstrate an alignment of the opportunity, entrepreneur and resources that coincides with current market conditions, including appropriate levels of risk and return;
> 5\. Provide meaningful milestones and realistic means of achieving them, explaining how you will actually achieve sales.
>
> “In many cases, the real value of writing a business plan is the process of actually creating it,” Bachenheimer said. “Don’t do it because someone needs it; do it as if your business depends on it.”

> On Dec. 6, Pace University’s Lubin School of Business held its fourth annual [Pace Pitch Contest](http://www.pace.edu/pitch) in New York. Open to full- or part-time college students, recent college graduates and first-time entrepreneurs, the contest is one of many like it nationwide that’s based on the popular “elevator pitch” concept.
>
> “Basically, imagine you’re in the lobby of a building where there happens to be a bunch of venture capitalists,” explains the contest’s director, Bruce Bachenheimer, clinical professor of management at Pace. “You get in the elevator and notice a partner at a big VC firm who’s riding up with you to the 40th or 50th floor. You have three minutes of captive time with this venture capitalist; can you tell him or her about your idea in a very concise, convincing, complete way?”
>
> Not many people can, according to Bachenheimer. The contestants in his pitch contest, however, are notable exceptions. They’ve mastered the art of entrepreneurial persuasion. It doesn’t matter what they’re presenting, Bachenheimer insists; they can sell it.
>
> “It’s not about the idea itself,” he says. “It’s the way of thinking and the process of doing it that’s important.”
>
> Still, the ideas are pretty great. Take this year’s winners, for instance. In the “Social Venture” category, MBA student Sarah Lipkin proposed a nationwide art program for mentally disabled individuals. In the “New Business” category, meanwhile, entrepreneur Joe DiPasquale presented his online start-up, CollegeWikis.com, which provides user-generated information about schools across the country.
>
> Both ideas are indicative of promising start-up trends—social entrepreneurship and Web 2.0—that are poised for continued growth in 2008.

> “In the area of social entrepreneurship, the impetus for starting a company is to further or advance a cause or purpose,” says Bruce Bachenheimer, clinical professor and program director at Pace’s Lubin School of Business. “It’s about a mission to address any number of ills, from AIDS to world hunger or environmental issues. And it’s about having a sustainable type of business. It’s something larger than just making money,” he continues. “It’s using entrepreneurship—the same skills and concepts you would apply to a commercial business—to solve important problems.”
>
> Sherri Muth, who earned a social entrepreneurship certificate at Pace, said she picked up important business skills through the program, which she applies to her work as the director for a nonprofit rehabilitation center that develops and finds jobs for people with disabilities. “One of the assignments was to write a business plan,” she recalls. “It made me realize that we need to run nonprofits just like any other kind of business. I took courses in law, strategic planning, business planning, budgeting, IT.”

> 
> “It does seem as if there’s somewhat more attention and resources being paid in the private sector to veterans. I just heard, for instance, this morning from a guest whose been on this show, Bruce Bachenheimer, who directs the Entrepreneurship Lab at Pace University, that his Entrepreneurship Lab, which is based in New York, just got a $50,000 grant from the foundation of an investment firm called Blackstone, so it’s called the Charitable Foundation of Blackstone, and they’ve actually earmarked $300,000, and so Pace was only just one of six groups that got that grant and they’re going to be underwriting a seven-week entrepreneurship boot  camp at Pace. It’s for men and a woman, so we would be interested in seeing what the percentages end up, but it’s in New York City’s Tri-State area. And interestingly, Blackstone reacting and responding to the White House initiative to hire veterans, has committed to hiring 50,000 veterans across its portfolio of companies so, over a five year period, and they’ve already done about 10,000 since they launched about a year ago.”

> 
> Bruce Bachenheimer is with the MIT Enterprise Forum in New York. He is also the director of entrepreneurship at Pace University. We spoke with him about what he believes are the most important developments of the twenty-first century.
> 
> BRUCE BACHENHEIMER: “If I were looking at technology that has really impacted us over the last ten years, I would go in order: mobile computing, the proliferation of digital media content, broadband -- mobile and at-home access -- social media platforms and user-generated content, cloud computing, digital photography and GPS. And what I mean by GPS is GPS for the masses, although global positioning systems have been around for quite a while.”
> 
> Mr. Bachenheimer says all of these things have worked together to revolutionize technology. And, he says the technology is constantly changing, faster than at any other time in history.
> 
BRUCE BACHENHEIMER: “The life cycle of these products are so much shorter. If you look at having a telephone, a home phone back in the nineteen fifties, sixties, seventies and eighties, it was exactly the same phone. Nothing changed for three or four decades.
> 
> "Basically you had a choice of three colors, tan, white or black. And you could either have it mounted on a wall or on a table top, whereas now you look at something like a cell phone. How many people have a cell phone that's more than a year or two old?”

> **Bruce Bachenheimer is director of entrepreneurship studies at Pace University's Lubin School of Business in New York City.**
> 
> *"Entrepreneurship is really a way of thinking and acting.  It's about being able to recognize opportunities, analyze opportunities and make them happen.  Entrepreneurs are very motivated, driven, passionate, persistent people, and I believe the only real difference between a commercial entrepreneur and a social entrepreneur is their underlying purpose.  The social entrepreneur is trying to make the world a better place, basically to enhance the capacity of society someway."* 
> 
> **Social entrepreneurs focus their efforts on a social issue.  That can mean setting up a business or non-profit that benefits another country, for example.**
> 
> *"Domestically, like early childhood education opportunities.  It could be internationally providing, you know, clean drinking water in sub-Sahara Africa, or fighting AIDS or poverty or protecting natural resources.  And the idea is just how do you harness that spirit and focus that on a pressing social issue, as opposed to simply a new business."*
> 
> **Bachenheimer says the field of social entrepreneurship has exploded in the past five years, and that says a lot about this generation wanting work with meaning.**

> The great baseball philosopher Yogi Berra once said, "It's difficult to make predictions, especially about the future." That might sound somewhat inane, but the underlying message is astute: The future is not only unpredictable, it's unknowable.
> 
> Although that is especially true when it comes to human behavior and societal norms—and so many variables are changing the way we teach, learn, worship and socialize these days—we can expect that innovative business concepts will be born out of the COVID-19 crisis.
>
> **How do we know? Entrepreneurship is often associated with some form of disruption, the creation of a significant change in the market. There is perhaps no time more "ripe for disruption” than during a crisis.** Airbnb and Uber were founded amid the 2008 financial crisis, and probably would not have succeeded if either was launched a few years earlier or later. Why? Ordinary people would not have been willing to turn their home into a hotel or their car into a taxi absent the financial distress they were facing. Same for customers, who were suddenly willing to sleep in a stranger’s bed and pay for a ride in a regular car. Once these concepts proved successful, they were able to become a new normal.

> What innovative business concepts will be born out of the COVID-19 crisis? We’ll have to wait and see. But what’s important to remember is that it’s not about making predictions or coming up with an interesting idea; it’s about the passion, persistence, and perseverance to actually make it happen. Remember what Yogi Berra said: "It ain’t over ’til it’s over."

> The "bulldozer parents" who seek to "clear a path" for their child to gain admission to a top ranked college, live by the rankings. Prospective students who define themselves by the numerical rank of the college they attend, live by the rankings. Colleges whose mission is simply to advance in the rankings, live by the rankings. And all may suffer tremendously because of college rankings.
> 
> So why live by the rankings? They offer a simplistic sorting mechanism and play on human nature. Why perpetuate them? Money. Mainly for the publishers of these rankings, but also for the institutions that rely on them as THE source for new student enrollment (i.e. tuition dollars). 
> 
> What’s a better alternative? Provide broad ratings around topics that could help students better select the college that’s the best FIT for them and rank colleges based on the VALUE they actually add. In other words: rank them on "outputs" (how well they prepare graduates) rather than "inputs" (high school grades, SAT scores, acceptance rates). Consider the incentives, having colleges select students based on who will help them advance in the rankings versus earning a reputation by preparing successful graduates.
> 
> Some colleges have successfully rejected the "games" associated with admissions and privilege. MIT does not offer athletic scholarships, have legacy admissions, include Latin honors upon graduation, or award honorary degrees. The institute is the epitome of a meritocracy. Others have excelled at adding value. Pace was ranked the best private university in the country for upward economic mobility of students. We are the embodiment of Opportunitas!

The definitive form of customer validation is getting someone to open their wallet and actually make a purchase.

**THE PROFESSOR IS IN: BRUCE BACHENHEIMER** <br/>
May 2018 <br/>
> **Bruce Bachenheimer** <br/>
> Clinical Professor of Management, Lubin School of Business <br/>
> Executive Director, Entrepreneurship Lab <br/>
> 
> Thirty-five years ago this month, Bruce Bachenheimer (BBA ’83) graduated from Pace with a degree in international management. Today, Bachenheimer is a vocal and vital member of the Pace Community, helping shape the minds of future business leaders in management and entrepreneurship. Bachenheimer recently took some time to chat with Opportunitas about what he’s working on, what he likes about Pace, and the current dynamism of New York City.
> 
> You’re both a professor at Lubin and in charge of the Entrepreneurship Lab. Tell us more about those roles.
> 
> What’s nice about teaching and running the Entrepreneurship Lab (eLab) is that I’m able to use the eLab and its many resources for my classes. It directly supports curricular instruction—things that happen in the classroom—but also provides co-curricular and extra-curricular support. For example, the eLab runs a pitch contest and business plan competition, in class we are pitching new business concepts and developing business plans.
> 
> Do you see that type of blending happening more in the future?
> The whole nature of education is changing. This idea of what’s called the “sage on the stage”—one person lecturing to a room of students lined up in rows—that worked during the industrial revolution. But now, people aren’t learning well that way and students want a lot more. Society has changed. Everyone has a short attention span, whether it's texting, Twitter, or one paragraph Yelp reviews. If students aren’t learning the way I teach, I have to change the way I teach.
> 
> Is there anything you’re working on that you’re particularly excited about?
> 
> I do research, read, and speak regularly about New York City’s entrepreneurial ecosystem. One thing I find particularly interesting is just how and why New York City transformed itself into an entrepreneurial city. We were big finance, traditional media, Madison Avenue ad agencies, iconic department stores. We had all of these major industries and Fortune 500 companies, but after the 2008 financial crisis we had to become a lot more entrepreneurial. How New York City did that is incredibly interesting. After the financial crisis, there’s so many things that have been done in a very strategic way. Everything from cutting some red tape to opening up Cornell Tech on Roosevelt Island. And now, New York City has surpassed Boston/Cambridge as the number two metro area for VC investment after Silicon Valley.
> 
> Do you think that entrepreneurial spirit is built into the DNA of the city?
> 
> There’s certainly some of that DNA—the immigrant story, Ellis Island, if I can make it here I can make it anywhere. Additionally, there are numerous entrepreneurial ecosystem models, delineating critical components of success. What is interesting about New York is a concept called the perception of desirability. An entrepreneur can locate almost anywhere, but right now New York City is a very desirable place to be. When I was growing up back in the 70s, nobody wanted to be here. That perception has changed so much, people from around the world want to live and work here, and sometimes you’re really not sure why. That perception of what’s cool and what’s desirable changes, and right now New York City has it.
> 
> What’s your favorite thing about working at Pace?
> 
> It was always a dream to teach. Without having a PhD and publishing regularly, the thought of being able to do so on a full-time basis at a major metropolitan University was something I didn’t think was possible. Pace made it possible and it’s been incredibly satisfying. I could be entering the classroom exhausted after a long day, wondering how I’m going to make it through a 3-hour night class, and within minutes, the energy from the students...I love it.

> In regards to the eLab, the autonomy. I’m happy to work toward institutional goals, the mission and objectives of the University or my School set, but the ability to do that independently and autonomously is very empowering and motivational. Given the mission and objectives, I’ve been afforded a huge degree of freedom to figure out how to best achieve them, and the resources to do it.

> What’s your personal brand? Can you state what you’d like it to be in a few sentences? How might someone you never met describe you as a brand after an online search?
> 
> In terms of a professional career, chances are your brand will not be based on a resume and cover letter. It will likely be shaped by a quick Google search, and your concern should go well beyond what embarrassing pictures might show up. No relevant results could be viewed as a blank resume.
> 
> Great companies are generally not looking for people that hope to follow instructions in return for a paycheck. They are looking for talent that can add value by solving problems and creating benefits. Instead of thinking about a firm hiring an individual employee, think about what that firm would look for in a new vendor or contractor.
> 
> Think of yourself as the CEO of ‘state your name here’ and figure out how to create a celebrity brand (okay, let’s start with niche micro-celebrity recognition). This is the start of an entrepreneurial mindset. Think about how you can add value and for whom. The company you want to work for should be a customer of your brand.
> 
> Up until recently, it was primarily entertainers and politicians that paid attention to their celebrity brand. Now the proliferation of user generated content via social media and the ease of search has created de facto personal branding and the rise of micro-celebrities (e.g. bloggers and YouTubers with a huge following).
> 
> So, what would you like your brand to be and how should you go about creating it?

> 
> The gig economy can provide workers with flexibility and independence, removing the walls and ceiling of a traditional job. It can also remove the floor of stability and security. The technology that enables individuals to provide these services directly to customers on such a large scale has relied on data analytics to do so efficiently and effectively. The resulting analytical information and insights are incredibly valuable, but can also be somewhat Orwellian.
> 
> An ever-increasing number of traditional jobs are incorporating elements of those in the gig economy. Our hypercompetitive, globalized, and constantly connected economy has placed new demands on employees, tracking value delivered and measuring efficiency. As with gig economy workers, employees will have to constantly demonstrate their worth. To me, this is the essence of an entrepreneurial mindset—a way of thinking and acting that is focused on imagining new ways to solve problems and provide benefits that create value. A lesson I learned early as my career began as a Wall Street trader where the motto was “You’re only as good as your last trade!”

**Generation Z in the Workforce** <br/>
Fall 2016 <br/>
By **Arize Lee** <br/>
> **They are creating their own career paths.*** Landing a job at a *Fortune* 500 company isn’t for everyone, but studies show that Gen Z is more interested in entrepreneurship than previous generations. Why? Professor Bruce Bachenheimer, executive director of Pace’s Entrepreneurship Lab, says they’re skeptical, having grown up during the recession. “Gen Z has seen their parents work as loyal employees for a big company, come home every day at 6:00 p.m. for dinner, and take their annual two weeks of vacation,” he says. “But then they watched as their parents were laid off, lost their dignity, and had to take two menial jobs to support themselves and the family. They questioned this loyalty to big companies and thought, ‘Do I have more control over my destiny id I go the entrepreneurial route?’”

**Entrepreneurship takes the University by storm** <br/>
October 29, 2014 <br/>
By **Arize Lee** <br/>
> Undoubtedly, the eLab founded in 2004 (sic), provides students and others with valuable knowledge and capital to pursue entrepreneurial aspirations, but eLab director Bruce Bachenheimer pointed out “It’s not about being an entrepreneurship major.”
> 
> “I’m here to bring University students in a collaborative work setting,” Bachenheimer explained. “What I would say to anyone interested, is come to the entrepreneurship lab, look around, ask some questions and apply.”
> 
> Through the application, “we understand what students are looking for and match them up with other students interested in doing something similar,” said Bachenheimer.
> 
> In addition to the video studio and private meeting room, the eLab has “a 3-D printer, poster printers and Alienware high-speed computers that are great for 3-D modeling and video editing,” Bachenheimer added.
> 
> Bachenheimer describes the facility as an ideal environment for anyone to conceptualize, test and launch a business concept. “There’s the space, there’s the equipment and there’s the people,” he said, identifying graduates in the engineering, finance and computing fields that work within the lab.
> 
> Bachenheimer warns that “this idea of going to look for a job is a problem. It’s no more, like a generation ago, that you just get hired. Almost all net new jobs are being created by small companies, less than 4 years old with under 100 employees.”  
> No matter what your occupation, “it’s about recognizing opportunity and creating value,” Bachenheimer stressed. “Pace University’s motto is Opportunitas and nothing is more synonymous with opportunity than entrepreneurship.”

> Mehta arrived at Pace in 2001 to earn an MBA, and Bachenheimer was one of his professors. Both men, who share a passion for global adventures, had taken unusual and circuitous paths into the classroom where they met.
> 
> Bachenheimer, a clinical professor of Management and director of entrepreneurship at the Lubin School of Business, had trod many successful paths before returning to Pace—where he received his undergraduate business degree—to share his global business expertise. Among other things, he had worked for the Bank of Tokyo and Westpac, a major Australian bank, then lived aboard his 36-foot sailboat in the Caribbean for a few years. After that he started a teak-importing company based in Annapolis, MD, catering largely to fellow sailors. He attended business school himself at 40 in Australia.

**Phelps Wins Pace Pitch Contest with Game Design** <br/>

By **Julissa Lopez** <br/>
> The Business Plan contest will be accepting applications until April 20, and will then take place on April 30. Both contests have been organized by head of entrepreneurship Bruce Bachenheimer.
> 
> The Pace Pitch contest was created by Bachenheimer three years ago, after having been inspired by a contest Bachenheimer participated in when he was in school.
> 
> Bachenheimer began the Pitch as a means for allowing students to network and contribute an idea that would mimic the real way business ventures are pitched. Moreover, he believes the contest is a positive experience allowing participants to get more involved in their community.
> 
> "I think it's a good way for people to get out here and do something commercially or socially that will help change the world," Bachenheimer said.
> 
> Additionally, according to Bachenheimer, the types of applicants has shifted, moving to include not only internal students, but faculty members, alumni and students from other universities as well.
> 
> Bachenheimer said, "We're trying to make these contests grow, and it's my hope that they become all inclusive. It's targeted at business students, but I'm glad to get everyone involved-nursing students, law students, and Dyson's as well."
> 
> "We've been lucky with growing in sponsors," Bachenheimer said.
> 
> Bachenheimer claims the Business Plan can be seen as an extension of the Pace Pitch. "It's a lot more involved, like the level after the Pitch contest," he said.

**Landing an Opportunity** <br/>
Fall 2005 <br/>
By **Sheila Smith Noonan** <br/>
> The Bush administration’s current policy toward this labor segment is favorable to small business owners, including immigrants. “Small business is very important to this president,” says Bruce Bachenheimer, PhD, clinical professor of management.
> 
> “One of \[George W. Bush’s\] first executive orders was that government agencies should not make any regulations that place a burden on small businesses.”
> 
> Many immigrants that are small business owners are also potential entrepreneurs. Bachenheimer contends that entrepreneurs possess certain personal characteristics, including a need for achievement, selfdirection, and the ability to accept risks to succeed. Certainly, moving to a new country simply indicates an acceptance of risk, but the goal-oriented “model minority” immigrants are the ones who use these characteristics to their advantage. “For America to be the land of opportunity, you have to create your own opportunity,” he says.

**Master Plan**  
July 5, 2000 <br/>
By **Gerald Noonan** 

> DOT-COM MYTHS
>
> Bruce Bachenheimer, a 30-something former Wall Street stockbroker who runs his own small company in Sydney, is completing his second year as an MBA student at AGSM.
> 
> Bachenheimer believes the schools have been forced to give the MBA an appropriate degree of IT orientation and market focus because they know that people undertaking the courses are highly motivated, intelligent and are doing it either to change careers, make money, or both.
>
> He has been impressed with the way AGSM has organised the management students to interact with students from the University of NSW's computer sciences and engineering faculty - one of the leading IT schools in Australia - as a sort of intellectual cross-fertilisation effort.
>
> He's also been surprised at the sophistication of an AGSM computer simulation program used to mimic the real world of stockmarket movements. "It's a real tool very similar to that with which I was trading $100 million to $1 billion a day on Wall Street," he says.
>
> But he, too, warns about getting too carried away with the glamour of the Internet e-commerce boom. "When you dissect the dot-com situation you still find the basics of the business model are what applies," he says.

**The model of a new-millennium worker** <br/>
May 18, 2000 <br/>
By **Catherine Fox**

> If the predictions are right about most of us having at least three careers in our working lives, then Bruce Bachenheimer is not a bad example of the new-millennium worker.
>
> He spent several years as a trader on Wall Street, travelled the world promoting a high-tech product for a US company and even opened a business importing teak from the Caribbean. He also managed to fit in a couple of years sailing around the Caribbean islands.
>
> A sheer coincidence led him to apply for an MBA course at the Australian Graduate School of Management, where he is still studying. And it is here, with fellow student Austin Hui, that he launched one of Australia's most popular share investor sites, StockCentral.
>
> Fitting in all of that while still in his 30s doesn't seem such a big deal to Bachenheimer. Not that lie's brash, but the softly spoken American does admit he gets very little sleep. Maybe four hours a night, after he trades on the US markets.
>
> Online entrepreneurs like Bachenheimer and Hui are coming from all walks of life, with a diverse range of skills, experience and qualifications. The classic barriers of age, education and geography mutter far less in the new economy than in the old.
>
> "I was asked if I'd be interested in doing it as a commercially viable site, and I already have my own web page so we worked to do that and founded a company this year,” says Bachenheimer.
>
> Within three months of relaunching, the site was attracting 1 million hits a month. Now there are around 2 million, he says.
>
> “If we grow too quickly we lose the way the site operates…it's high-quality information and no ramping of stocks. Other online forums are being done but not with as high quality," says Bachenheimer.
>
> It all sounds a long way from living on a yacht for two years in the Caribbean, although that lifestyle inspired another career. "I didn't know what I wanted to do," Bachenheimer says. "That's when I started the wood company. I wanted to work with my hands."
>
> A strong desire to see the world kept Bachenheimer busy for several years and also led him to apply for the MBA. He was walking past the Australian consulate in New York and saw a sign offering information on doing an MBA in Sydney. That was enough to trigger an application.
>
> "Coming here was more of a life experience or an end, not a means to an end,” he says.
> 
> His work with StockCentral has dovetailed with his studies at the AGSM, which is refocusing to include more e-commerce emphasis. The business school this week launched an e-business incubator, with second-year MBA students running the project with help from faculty and other experts. A number of new business ideas are already in the pipeline.
>
> The incubator will concentrate on the development of start-ups, and although StockCentral has already grown beyond that stage, it would still benefit from some of the expertise, says Bachenheimer.
>
> It sounds as though he is unlikely to be getting more sleep over the next few months.

February/March 1995

> Bruce Bachenheimer, another anchor dropper, still lives aboard his boat in Spa Creek. He has become an importer of teak lumber. Not old enough to have a mid-life crisis, Bruce has already led several lives—he was a student in Japan, a Wall Street trader, an offshore cruiser, and now an Annapolis businessman. Coming to Annapolis from Venezuela and the Caribbean, he ducked into the harbor to escape nasty weather and decided to stay. In true Annapolitan fashion, he opened his business, Annapolis Maritime Corporation, on the 4th of July 1993.
>
> "I stayed because I liked the colonial flavor, the seaport atmosphere, and Bay sailing. But what really surprised me is how receptive everyone has been. There's no good old boy, closed preppy network here," he says. "Everyone from old timers to newcomers have been helpful and friendly to me since I went into business."

April 21 – May 4, 1994 (Volume II, Number 8)

> You don’t have to be a boater to know that one of the wonders of the world is teak.
>
> In the Phillippines, pilings made of teak wood have endured 1,000 years. In Asia, they’re making boards out of teak logs that laid on the bottom of the Burma River for 100 years.
>
> So it comes as no surprise that when Bruce Bachenheimer was looking for something special in life, something satisfying yet saner than life as a bond trader in New York, he turned to teak.
>
> Bachenheimer is the founder of Annapolis Maritime Corp., which has begun importing teak to the Chesapeake Bay. From his shop on Lincoln Drive in Annapolis, Bachenheimer has begun selling his wood at a price he says is lower than what boaters usually see.
>
> There are stories in Bachenheimer’s arrival and his wood’s. Bachenheimer, 32, a New York native, grew up in the high-finance world of bond-trading and foreign exchange with a specialty in Japanese curency. On an average day, he might handle $2 billion in yen.

> But like many people these days, he longed for a different life. So with the economy going south, so did Bachenheimer — first on a 22-foot sailboat and then on a Pearson 36 Cutter. He stayed two years in the Caribbean and South American ports before arriving in Annapolis last July 4. Why here?
>
> “Annapolis seemed like a good fit, a good place in the middle,” he says.
>
> But how to make a living? Bachenheimer had grown enamored with teak and he had wood skills to boot. With so many boats on the Bay, his plan started taking shape.
>
> Getting rare teak is another story. Malaysia, Burma (now Myanmar) and traditional teak-growing lands have largely been plundered. Bachenheimer worried, too, about the notion that teak clearcutting has sped the destruction of rain forests, a hazardous reputation for a retailer to carry in these times.
>
> He has overcome problems by finding his sources on controlled plantations in Costa Rica and on Caribbean islands that he prefers not to name. In these latitudes, governments have learned that they can sustain a valuable commodity by regulating cuts and overseeing planting.
>
> Locating the wood and shipping it poses more than a few headaches but Bachenheimer’s business is up and running. Besides selling teak for boats, Bachenheimer is crafting tables from his precious raw material and promoting sales of it for the home.
>
> Bachenheimer, who lives on his boat at the Liberty Marina, doesn’t sound like he misses the hustle of New York.
>
> “I wanted to make something,” he observes. “Before, it was just working with numbers.”

March/April 1994 <br/>

> **Bachenheimer Going For Teak**
>
> When the Annapolis Maritime Corporation, a direct importer of teak lumber, recently announced its opening, it brought company president Bruce Bachenheimer a long way from his former job.
>
> Not long ago he was an investment banker and trader on Wall Street.
>
> Sitting in his new office, with his storage and work rooms just behind him, and teak tables and cutting boards at his side, Bachenheimer says that Wall Street is a life that he doesn't miss at all.
>
> After several years of trading billions of dollars a week, Bachenheimer starting planning his escape.
>
> "I came to Annapolis for the boat show, and to the Naval Academy for their Safety at Sea program.
>
> "I'm not a lifelong sailor. For me, sailing was just a means to an end.
>
> "I wanted to travel and be independent and self sufficient. So I went to a boat show and bought a boat, and I went to school and learned navigation.
>
> "Then, a couple of years ago, I left Wall Street and took off on my sailboat. I spent two years in the Caribbean and Venezuela" going from grey pin stripe suits to bearded and tan.
>
> "I decided it might be fun to start a business. I looked around, and the rents were reasonable and the business climate friendly, and I decided that I would import teak and do some woodworking.
>
> "Having worked all that time just trading, really making nothing but money, mostly for the banks, I just wanted to make something with my hands, to create something. And I think teak is a beautiful wood to work with.
>
> "So I did a business plan, and it looked feasible. It looked like there was a good demand in the area, and the price that I can sell the wood at is much lower than anyone else here.
>
> "I'm directly importing it. Normally you would have an importer, a distributer, a wholesaler, a local distributer and a local retail shop. So you cut out four or five layers.
>
> "And then there's the environmental aspect. The wood that I buy is all farmed on plantations under local government supervision and exported under license, so its something that I can feel good about.

**When Yuppies Turn Good** <br/>
January/February 1992 (Volume 3, Number 2) <br/>
By **Susan Barry**

> It’s 9 a.m. on a weekday and Bruce Bachenheimer, captain/owner and resident on Deliberate, is enjoying his coffee under a palm tree. He is relaxed, tanned, newly bearded and barefoot.
> 
> "This time last year? By 9:30 in the morning the major part of the trading day was already over," said the former Senior Trader from Westpac Banking Corporation, the oldest and largest bank in Australia.
> 
> "I would have been staying up to 2 or 3 a.m. getting calls from Tokyo, then awake at 4:30 or 5 to receive the calls from London and at the office on Wall Street by 7 a.m. In those days it was grey pin stripes, now going formal means carrying my shoes with me," he laughs good-naturedly.
> 
> Bachenheimer graduated with honors from Pace University in 1983 with a degree in business and a knowledge of and interest in Japanese language and culture. His first job after college was as a trader with the Bank of Tokyo.
> 
> While much of the world is sleeping the banks of the world conduct their business through the banker's bank, the Federal Reserve in New York. Money is bought, sold and borrowed, accounts squared, fortunes made and lost. And it's guys like Bachenheimer who are making the deals.
> 
>  “The change in trading really came about when the interest rates went through the roof in the late 70's and then the 80's boom in the market but by the late 80's, with the global recession, there was a slowdown and the boom was over. The extravagance and parties were over."
> 
> The former Life in the Fast Lane trader now lives aboard his 36' Pearson cutter, Deliberate, in Great Cruz Bay, St. John. Having thoroughly researched various types of sailboats the Pearson was chosen for her seaworthiness and excellent condition.
> 
> "On the way down here we hit two full hurricanes and some storms and she felt like she was on railroad tracks," said Bachenheimer.
> 
> Deliberate made the voyage from Connecticut to Norfolk, Virginia offshore. The Norfolk to Beaufort, North Carolina was on the Intercoastal Waterway. From the ICW to the Virgin Islands the computer navigation equipment died. "So I used the sextant. We sailed into Culebra thinking it was St. Thomas but - hey - it was a 1300 miles voyage and we were only off by 30 miles, so that's not so bad.
> 
> "But the best part of the trip is being on watch by yourself and seeing the sun come up over an endless ocean."

**The Bank of Tokyo in "The Big Apple"** <br/>
May 1985 (No. 308) <br/>

> I joined the Bank of Tokyo, Ltd. as a Money Market Trader in 1983, for the excitement and action which is generated here. Another, more personal reason, is that I can maintain my contact with the Japanese language, culture and business methods which I studied at Tsukuba National University in Japan and at Pace University in New York, where I earned my degree in International Management. I am continuing to study Japanese at New York University.
> 
> Although trading hundreds of millions of dollars (for one of the leading International Banks in the Financial Center of the world) is exciting, the most interesting and rewarding aspect of my work is the daily contact I have with people around the world and with other traders on Wall Street. Although I expected to be in a highly competitive environment, it was a pleasant surprise to find that the people I deal with are friendly and cooperative. The real competition is "The Market".
