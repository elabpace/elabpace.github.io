> 
> *(A Transcript from 46:09 – 47:14)*
> 
> “It does seem as if there’s somewhat more attention and resources being paid in the private sector to veterans. I just heard, for instance, this morning from a guest whose been on this show, Bruce Bachenheimer, who directs the Entrepreneurship Lab at Pace University, that his Entrepreneurship Lab, which is based in New York, just got a $50,000 grant from the foundation of an investment firm called Blackstone, so it’s called the Charitable Foundation of Blackstone, and they’ve actually earmarked $300,000, and so Pace was only just one of six groups that got that grant and they’re going to be underwriting a seven-week entrepreneurship boot  camp at Pace. It’s for men and a woman, so we would be interested in seeing what the percentages end up, but it’s in New York City’s Tri-State area. And interestingly, Blackstone reacting and responding to the White House initiative to hire veterans, has committed to hiring 50,000 veterans across its portfolio of companies so, over a five year period, and they’ve already done about 10,000 since they launched about a year ago.”

**A Whole New World, Brought to Us by Gizmos and Gadgets** <br/>
December 26, 2010 <br/>
Hosted by **June Simms and Steve Ember** <br/>
> *Pace University Professor Bruce Bachenheimer was interviewed for* **Voice of America’s Special English Technology Report**. *The complete article and audio of the broadcast is available at the above URL. The following is a partial transcript of the program*:
> 
> Bruce Bachenheimer is with the MIT Enterprise Forum in New York. He is also the director of entrepreneurship at Pace University. We spoke with him about what he believes are the most important developments of the twenty-first century.
> 
> BRUCE BACHENHEIMER: “If I were looking at technology that has really impacted us over the last ten years, I would go in order: mobile computing, the proliferation of digital media content, broadband -- mobile and at-home access -- social media platforms and user-generated content, cloud computing, digital photography and GPS. And what I mean by GPS is GPS for the masses, although global positioning systems have been around for quite a while.”
> 
> Mr. Bachenheimer says all of these things have worked together to revolutionize technology. And, he says the technology is constantly changing, faster than at any other time in history.
> 
BRUCE BACHENHEIMER: “The life cycle of these products are so much shorter. If you look at having a telephone, a home phone back in the nineteen fifties, sixties, seventies and eighties, it was exactly the same phone. Nothing changed for three or four decades.
> 
> "Basically you had a choice of three colors, tan, white or black. And you could either have it mounted on a wall or on a table top, whereas now you look at something like a cell phone. How many people have a cell phone that's more than a year or two old?”

**Rice University recently held a consortium on the growing field of teaching entrepreneurship.** <br/>
October 19, 2009 <br/>
Hosted by **Ed Mayberry** <br/>
> The following is a transcript of the WKUHF interview:
> 
> **Bruce Bachenheimer is director of entrepreneurship studies at Pace University's Lubin School of Business in New York City.**
> 
> *"Entrepreneurship is really a way of thinking and acting.  It's about being able to recognize opportunities, analyze opportunities and make them happen.  Entrepreneurs are very motivated, driven, passionate, persistent people, and I believe the only real difference between a commercial entrepreneur and a social entrepreneur is their underlying purpose.  The social entrepreneur is trying to make the world a better place, basically to enhance the capacity of society someway."* 
> 
> **Social entrepreneurs focus their efforts on a social issue.  That can mean setting up a business or non-profit that benefits another country, for example.**
> 
> *"Domestically, like early childhood education opportunities.  It could be internationally providing, you know, clean drinking water in sub-Sahara Africa, or fighting AIDS or poverty or protecting natural resources.  And the idea is just how do you harness that spirit and focus that on a pressing social issue, as opposed to simply a new business."*
> 
> **Bachenheimer says the field of social entrepreneurship has exploded in the past five years, and that says a lot about this generation wanting work with meaning.**
> 
> *A podcast of the interview is available at*: [http://bit.ly/RadioKUHF](http://bit.ly/RadioKUHF).
